<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>The following reminiscences after due and
careful consideration, are dedicated to the
young, who are pausing at the portals of manhood,
as well as womanhood, and who are confronted
with illusory visions and representations,
the goal of which is but seldom attained,
even by the fewest fortunates, and then only by
unforeseen circumstances and haphazards, not
illustrated in the mapped out program for
future welfare, greatness and success.</p>

<p>Often the most sanguine persons have such
optimistic illusions, which, unless most carefully
considered will lead them into irreparable
errors. Even the political changes, often times
necessary in the government of men, are great
factors to smash into fragments the best and
most illusory plans, and cast into the shadow,
for a time being at least, the kindliest, philanthropic
and best intentions of individual efforts,
until the Wheel of Fortune again turns in his
direction, casting a few sparks of hope in his
ultimate favor, and which is seldom realized.</p>

<p>If the reader of the above has been induced
to think and carefully consider, before acting
hastily, the writer feels that he has accomplished
some good in the current affairs of
human events.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>


<div class="center">A PICTURE.</div>

<p>Entering the post-office for my daily mail,
I noticed in the lobby, hanging on the wall, a
beautiful, attractive and highly colored landscape
and manhood therein displayed in its
perfection, gaudily dressed in spotless uniforms;
some on horseback, some afoot, with
a carriage as erect and healthful demeanor
that the artist could undoubtedly produce; he
was at his best, setting forth a life of ease and
comfort that would appeal to the youngster,
patriot and careless individual, that therein is
a life worth living for. Even the social features
have not been omitted where men and officers
stand in good comradeship. Peace and repose,
and a full dinner pail are the environment
of the whole representation.</p>

<p>It is the advertisement of an army recruiting
officer, who wants to enlist young, healthy men
for the service of the executive branch of our
National Government, to defend the boundaries
of our territory, to protect our people against
the invasion of a foreign foe, to even invade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
a foreign land, to kill and be killed at the behest
of the powers that be, for an insult whether
imaginary or real, that probably could have
been settled through better entente, or if the
political atmosphere would have thought to
leave the matter of misunderstanding or misconstruction
to a tribunal of arbitration.</p>

<p>The writer himself was once a soldier; the
uniform he wore did not correspond with that
of the picture above, it was rather the reverse
in all its features. He enlisted in the Confederate
service in 1861, when our homes were
invaded, in defense of our firesides, and the
Confederate States of America, who at that
time, were an organized Government.</p>

<p>Usually an artist, when he represents a subject
on canvas, uses a dark background, to
bring forth in bright relief, the subject of his
work. But I, not being an artist, reverse the
matter in controversy, and put the bright side
first.</p>


<div class="center">OTHER PICTURES.</div>

<p>When in 1861 the Southern States, known as
the Slave States, severed their connection with
the Federal Government and formed a Confederacy
of their own, which under the Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Constitution and Common Compact, they had a
perfect right to do, they sent Commissioners,
composed of John Forsyth, Martin J. Crawford
and A. B. Boman to Washington, with
power to adjust in a peaceable manner, any differences
existing between the Confederate
Government and their late associates. Our
Government refrained from committing any
overt act, or assault, and proposed strictly to
act on the defensive, until that Government, in
a most treacherous manner, attempted to maintain
by force of arms, property, then in their
possession and belonging to the Confederate
Government, and which they had promised to
surrender or abandon. But on the contrary,
they sent a fleet loaded with provisions, men
and munitions of war, to hold and keep Fort
Sumter, in the harbor of South Carolina, contrary
to our expectations, and as a menace to
our new born Nation.</p>

<p>Then, as now, there were State troops, or
military organizations, and being on the alert,
under the direction of our Government, and
under the immediate command of General
Beauregard, they fired on the assaulting fleet to
prevent a most flagrant outrage, and after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
fierce conflict, the Fort was surrendered, by one
Capt. Anderson, then in command.</p>

<p>Abraham Lincoln, the then President of the
United States, called out 75,000 troops, which
was construed by us as coercion on the part of
the Federal Government, so as to prevent the
Confederates from carrying out peaceably the
maintenance of a Government already formed.
To meet such contingency President Jefferson
Davis called for volunteers. More men presented
themselves properly organized into Companies,
than we had arms to furnish. Patriotism
ran high, and people took up arms as by
one common impulse, and formed themselves
into regiments and brigades.</p>

<p>The Federal Government, with few exceptions,
had all the arsenals in their possession.
We were therefore not in a condition to physically
withstand a very severe onslaught, but
when the Northern Army attempted on July
21, 1861, to have a holiday in Richmond, the
Capital of the Confederate States, we taught
them a lesson at Manassas, and inscribed a page
in history for future generations to contemplate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<p>The Federal army under General Scott consisted
of over 60,000 men, while that of General
J. E. Johnston was only half that number.
Someone asked General Scott, why he, the hero
of Mexico, had failed to enter Richmond. He
answered, because the boys that led him into
Mexico are the very ones that kept him out of
Richmond.</p>

<p>The proclamation of Abraham Lincoln calling
out for troops was responded to with alacrity.
In the meantime, we on the Confederate side,
were not asleep; Washington County had then
only one military organization of infantry
called the Washington Rifles, commanded by
Captain Seaborn Jones, a very gallant old gentleman,
who was brave and patriotic. The following
was a list of the Company's membership,
who, by a unanimous vote, offered their services
to the newly formed Government to repel the
invader: (See Appendix A.). Their services
were accepted, and they were ordered to Macon,
Ga., as a camp of instructions, and for the formation
of a regiment, of which the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
companies formed the contingent&mdash;their names,
letters, and captains. (See Appendix B.)</p>

<p>J. N. Ramsey, of Columbus, Ga., was elected
Colonel. We were ordered to Pensacola, Fla.,
for duty, and to guard that port, and to keep
from landing any troops by our enemy who
were in possession of the fort, guarding the
entrance of that harbor. This was in the month
of April, 1861. From Pensacola the regiment
was ordered to Northwestern Virginia. The
Confederate Capital was also changed from
Montgomery, Ala., where the Confederate Government
was organized, and Jefferson Davis
nominated its President, to Richmond, Va.</p>

<p>About the middle of May, the same year,
twenty-one young men of this County, of which
the writer formed a contingent part, resolved
to join the Washington Rifles, who had just
preceded us on their way to Virginia. We rendezvoused
at Davisboro, a station on the Central
of Georgia Railway. We were all in high spirit
on the day of our departure. The people of
the neighborhood assembled to wish us Godspeed
and a safe return. It was a lovely day
and patriotism ran high. We promised a satisfactory
result as soldiers of the Confederate
States of America.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>At Richmond, Va., we were met by President
Davis, who came to shake hands with the
"boys in gray", and speak words of encouragement.
From Richmond we traveled by rail to
Staunton, where we were furnished with accoutrements
by Colonel Mikel Harmon, and which
consisted of muskets converted into percussion
cap weapons, from old revolutionary flint and
steel guns, possessing a kicking power that
would put "Old Maude" to shame. My little
squad had resolved to stick to one another
through all emergencies, to aid and assist each
other and to protect one another. Those resolutions
were carried out to the letter as long as
we continued together. We still went by rail to
Buffalo Gap, when we had to foot it over the
mountains to McDowell, a little village in the
Valley of the Blue Ridge. Foot-sore and weary
we struck camp. The inhabitants were hospitable
and kind, and we informed ourselves
about everything in that country, Laurel Hill
being our destination.</p>

<p>An old fellow whose name is Sanders, a very
talkative gentlemen, told us how, he by himself
ran a dozen Yankees; every one of us became
interested as to how he did it, so he stated that
one morning he went to salt his sheep in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pasture&mdash;all of a sudden there appeared a dozen
or more Yankee soldiers, so he picked up his
gun, and ran first, and they ran after him, but
did not catch him. We all felt pretty well sold
out and had a big laugh, for the gentleman
demonstrated his tale in a very dramatic way.</p>

<p>The following morning, we concluded to hire
teams to continue our journey, which was within
two days march of our destination. We passed
Monterey, another village at the foot of the
Alleghany Mountains, about twelve miles from
McDowell. We crossed the Alleghany into
Green Brier County, passed Huttensville,
another little village at the foot of Cheat Mountain,
from there to Beverly, a village about
twelve miles from Laurel Hill, where we were
entertained with a spread, the people having
heard of our approach. We camped there that
night, and passed commandery resolution upon
its citizens, and their kind hospitality. The
following day we arrived at Laurel Hill, where
the army, about 3,000 strong, was encamped.
The boys were glad to see us, and asked thousands
of questions about their home-folks, all of
which was answered as far as possible. The
writer being a Frenchman, a rather scarce article
in those days in this country, elicited no little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
curiosity among the members of the First
Georgia Regiment. Sitting in my tent, reading
and writing, at the same time enjoying my pipe,
I noted at close intervals shadows excluding the
light of day&mdash;looking for the cause, the party or
parties instantly withdrew. Major U. M. Irwin
entered; I asked him the cause for such curiosity,
he stated laughing, "Well, I told some fellows
we'd brought a live Frenchman with us.
I suppose those fellows want to get a peep at
you." I at once got up, mounted an old stump,
and introduced myself to the crowd: "Gentlemen,
it seems that I am eliciting a great deal of
curiosity; now all of you will know me as Isaac
Hermann, a native Frenchman, who came to
assist you to fight the Yankees." Having thus
made myself known, I took the privilege to ask
those with whom I came in contact their names,
and what Company they belonged to, and thus
in a short time I knew every man in the Regiment.
We were now installed and regularly
enrolled for duty.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>


<p>Laurel Hill is a plateau situated to the right
of Rich Mountain, the pass of which was occupied
by Governor Wise, with a small force.</p>

<p>In the early part of July, General McClelland,
in command of the Federal troops, made a
demonstration on our front. Our position was
somewhat fortified by breastworks; the enemy
came in close proximity to our camp and kept
us on the Qui-vive; their guns were of long
range, while ours would not carry over fifty
yards. Picket duties were performed by whole
companies, taking possession of the surrounding
commanding hills. Many shots hissed in
close proximity, without our being able to locate
the direction from which they came, and without
our even being able to hear the report of
the guns. Very little damage, however, was
done, except by some stray ball, now and then.
It was the writer's time to stand guard, not far
in front of the camp, his beat was alongside
the ditches. In front of me the enemy had
planted a cannon. The shots came at regular
intervals in direct line with my beat, but the
shots fell somewhat short, by about fifty to seventy-five
yards. I saw many hit the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
When Lieutenant Colonel Clark, came round on
a tour of inspection, I remarked, "Colonel, am
I placed here as a target to be shot at by those
fellows yonder. One of their shots came rather
close for comfort." He said, "Take your beat
in the ditch, and when you see the smoke, tuck
your head below the breastworks"&mdash;which was
three and one-half feet deep the dirt drawn
towards the front, which protected me up to
my shoulders. For nearly two hours, until
relieved, I kept close watch for the smoke of
their gun, which I approximated was about a
mile distant, and there I learned that it took the
report of the cannon eight seconds to reach me
after seeing the smoke, and the whiz of the
missile four seconds later still; this gave me
about twelve seconds to dodge the ball&mdash;anyhow,
I was very willing when relief came, for
the other fellow to take my place. In the afternoon,
minnie balls rather multipherous, were
hissing among the boys in camp, but up to that
time there was no damage done, when a cavalryman
came in and reported that some of the
enemy was occupying an old log house situated
about a half mile in front of us, and it was
there through the cracks of that building came
the missiles that made the fellows dodge about.
General Garnett, our Commander, ordered out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
two companies of infantry, who, taking a long
detour through the woods placed themselves in
position to receive them as they emerged from
the building, and with two pieces of artillery,
sent balls and shells through their improvised
fort. Out came the "Yanks" only to fall into
the hands of those ready to give them a warm
reception.</p>

<p>On that evening, three days rations were
issued. At dark it commenced drizzling rain;
we were ordered to strike camp, and we took up
the line of march to the rear, when I learned
that the enemy had whipped out Governor
Wise's forces on Rich Mountain and threatened
our rear. We marched the whole of that night,
only to find our retreat to Beverly blockaded
by the enemy who had felled many trees across
the road, the only turn pike leading to that
place.</p>

<p>We had to retrace our steps for several miles,
and take what is known as mountain trail, leading
in a different direction, marching all day.
The night again, which was dark and dreary
multiplied our misgivings. The path we followed,
was as stated, a narrow mountain path,
on the left insurmountable mountains, while on
the right very deep precipices; many teams that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
left the rut on account of the darkness, were
precipitated down the precipices and abandoned.
Thus, after two nights and one day of steady
marching, we arrived at Carricks' Ford, a fordable
place on the north fork of the Potomac
River. The water was breast-deep, and we went
into it like ducks, when of a sudden, the Yankees
appeared, firing into our column. They
struck us about and along the wagon train,
capturing the same, while the advance column
stampeded. We lost our regimental colors,
which were in the baggage wagon, in charge
of G. W. Kelly, who abandoned it with all the
Company's effects, to save himself.</p>

<p>Colonel Ramsey, in fact all our officers were
elected on account of their cleverness at home.
This being a strictly agricultural country, the
men and officers knew more about farming than
about military tactics. Colonel Ramsey was an
eminent lawyer of Columbus, Georgia. He
gave the command, "Georgian, retreat," and
the rout was complete. It was a great mistake
that the Government did not assign military
men to take charge in active campaigns; many
blunders might have been evaded and many
lives spared at the beginning of the war.</p>

<p>One half of my regiment was assigned as rear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
guards and marched therefore, in the rear of the
column behind the wagon train. We were consequently
left to take care of ourselves the best
we could. General Garnett was killed in the
melee. Had we had officers who understood anything
about military tactics, these reminiscences
might be told differently.</p>

<p>As soon as we heard firing in our front, we at
once formed ourselves into line of battle, in a
small corn patch across the stream, on our
immediate right, at the foot of a high mountain.
It seemed to have been new ground and
the corn was luxuriantly thick. The logs that
were there were rolled into line, thus serving
as terraces, and also afforded us splendid breastworks.
We were hardly in position, when artillery
troops appeared and crossed the ford, not
seventy-five yards from where we were in line,
seeing them, without being seen ourselves.
Major Harvey Thompson, who was in Command
of our forces, which were not over four
hundred and fifty strong, seeing some men making
ready to fire, gave orders not to fire, as they
were our own men crossing the stream, and thus
lost the opportunity of making himself famous,
for it proved to be the enemy's artillery in our
immediate front. Had he given orders to fire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and charge, we could have been on them before
they could possibly have formed themselves
into battery, captured their guns, killed and
captured many of their men, and would have
turned into victory what proved to have become
a disastrous defeat.</p>

<p>Thus being cut off from our main forces, who
were in full retreat, and fearing to be captured,
we climbed the mountain in our rear, expecting
to cut across in a certain direction, and rejoin
our forces some distance beyond. Thus began
a dreary march of three days and four nights in
a perfect wilderness, soaked to the bone and
nothing to eat, cutting our way through the
heavy growth of laurel bushes, we had to take
it in Indian file, in single column.</p>

<p>Many pathetic instances came to my observation;
some reading testaments, others taking
from their breast-pocket, next to their heart,
pictures of loved ones, dropping tears of
despair, as they mournfully returned them to
their receptacle. An instance which impressed
itself forcibly on my mind, was the filial affection
displayed between father and son, and in
which the writer put to good use, the Biblical
story of King Solomon, where two women
claimed the same child, but in this instance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
neither wanted to claim. It was thus: Captain
Jones found a piece of tallow candle about one
inch long in his haversack, and presented it to
his son, Weaver, saying, "Eat that, son, it will
sustain life;" "No, father, you eat it, I am
younger than you, and stronger, and therefore
can hold out longer." There they stood
looking affectionately at each other, the Captain
holding the piece of candle between his fingers.
So I said, "Captain, hand it to me, I will divide
it for you." Having my knife in hand, I cut it
lengthwise, following the wick, giving each
half, and passing the blade between my lips. It
was the first taste of anything the writer had
had in four days.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<p>When night overtook us, we had to remain in
our track until daylight would enable us to proceed.
When at about nine o'clock A. M. word
was passed up the line, from mouth to mouth&mdash;"A
Guide! A man and his son who will guide
us out of here." Then Major Thompson, who
was in front sent word down the line for the
men to come up. The guides sent word up the
line to meet them half way, that they were very
tired, so it was arranged that Major Thompson
met them about center, where the writer was.
The guides introduced themselves as Messrs.
Parson, father and son. The senior was a man
of about fifty years, rather ungainly as to looks,
and somewhat cross-eyed, while his son was a
strong athletic young man, about twenty-three.
They said they were trappers, collecting furs
for the market. It must be remarked that that
country was perfectly wild, and uninhabited, for
during all this long march I had not seen a single
settlement, but it contained many wild
beasts, such as bears, panthers, foxes, deer, etc.
He related that a tall young man by the name
of Jasper Stubbs, belonging to Company E,
First Regiment, Washington Rifles, came to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
quarters very early this morning, inquiring if
any soldiers had passed by, saying he found a
nook under a projecting rock where he stood in
column the night before, and to protect himself
from dew, he lay down to rest, and fell asleep.
When he awoke, it was day and he found his
comrades gone, and that he was by himself. The
surface of ground or rock, was a solid moss-bed,
consequently he could not tell which way our
tracks pointed, and he happened to take the
reverse course which we went, and thus came
to where the Parsons lived. Stubbs was missing,
thus proving that the men's story must be
true. It must also be remembered that the
majority of the people in Western Virginia
were in sympathy with the enemy, and thus possessed
of many informers or spies, who would
give information as to our whereabouts and
doings.</p>

<p>A conference was held among the officers as
to what was best to be done. Parson claimed
to be in sympathy with the South, and he knew
that we would not be able to carry out our
design, and that we would all perish, so he put
out to lead us out of our dilemma. Major
Thompson was for putting the Parsons under
arrest, and force them to lead us in the direction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
we first assumed, or perish with us. Parsons
spoke up and said, "Gentlemen, I am in your
power; the country through which you propose
to travel is not habitable, I have been raised
in these regions, and there is not a living soul
within forty miles in the direction you propose
to go, and at the rate you are compelled to
advance, you would all perish to death, and
your carcasses left for food to the wild beasts
of the forest." The conference was divided,
some hesitated, others were for adopting Major
Thompson's plan, when the writer stepped forward,
saying, "Gentlemen, up to now, I have
obeyed orders, but I for one, prefer to be shot
by an enemy's bullet, than to perish like a coward
in this wild region." Captain Jones tapped
me on the shoulder, remarking; "Well spoken,
Hermann, those are my sentiments&mdash;Company
E, About Face!". Captain Crump, commanding
Company I, from Augusta, Ga., followed
suit, and thus the whole column faced about,
ready to follow the Parsons.</p>

<p>The writer made the following proposition:
That Mr. Parson and son be disarmed, for both
carried hunting rifles; that I would follow them
within twenty paces, while the column should
follow within two hundred yards, thus in case of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
treachery they would be warned by report of my
gun, that there is danger ahead. These precautions
I deemed necessary in case of an ambush.
Addressing myself to our guides, I said, "Gentlemen,
you occupy an enviable position; if you
prove true, of which I have no doubt myself,
you'd be amply rewarded, but should you prove
otherwise, your hide is mine, and there is not
enough guns in Yankeedom to prevent me from
shooting you." At this point, a private from
the Gate City Guards, whose name is Wm.
Leatherwood, remarked, "You shall not go
alone, I will accompany you." I thanked him
kindly, saying I would be glad if he would. Thus
we retraced our steps, following our leaders,
when after about three miles march we struck
a mountain stream, in the bed of which we
waded for nine miles, the water varying from
knee to waist deep, running very rapidly over
mossy, slippery rocks, and through gorges as if
the mountains were cut in twain and hewn
down. In some places, the walls were so high,
affording a narrow dark passage, I don't believe
God's sun ever shone down there. I was so
chilled, I felt myself freezing to death in mid
summer, for it was about the 17th of July; darkness
was setting in, and I had not seen the sun
that day, although the sky was cloudless, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
to my great relief we came to a little opening on
our left, the mountain receding, leaving about an
acre of level ground, with a luxuriant growth of
grass. Our guides said they lived within a
quarter of a mile from there. I said, let us rest
and wait for the rest of the men. When after a
little rest, I started again, I was too weak to
make the advance, although provisions were in
sight. I had to be relieved, and some others
took my place, while I lay exhausted on the
grass. Happily some of the men had paper that
escaped humidity; loading a musket with wadding,
they fired into a rotten stump, setting it
on fire, and by persistent blowing, produced a
bright little flame, which soon developed into a
large camp fire, around which the boys dried
themselves.</p>

<p>Parson proved himself a noble, patriotic
host. After a couple of hours, he sent us a large
pone of corn-bread, baked in an old-fashioned
oven. I received about an inch square as my
share,&mdash;the sweetest morsel that ever passed
my lips. It was sufficient to allay the gnawing
of my empty stomach,&mdash;it had a strange effect
on me, for every time I would stand up, my
knees would give way and down I went otherwise
I felt no inconvenience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a remarkable fact that every man was
able to keep up with our small column and we
did not lose a single man up to that time.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>


<p>The next morning Mr. Parson drove up two
nice, seal fat beeves,&mdash;to get rations was a quick
performance, and the meat was devoured before
it had time to get any of the animal heat out of
it, some ate it raw, others stuck it on the ramrod
of their gun and held it over the fire, in the
meantime biting off great mouthfulls while the
balance was broiling on his improvised cooking
utensil. Mr. Parson also brought us some meal,
which being made into dough was baked in the
ashes, and thus we all had a square meal and
some left to carry in our haversack.</p>

<p>Mr. Parson was tolerably well to do, he
owned some land, raised his truck, had a small
apple orchard, and indulged in stock-raising.
He owned several horses and some of the officers
bought of him. The writer feeling badly
jaded, also concluded he would buy himself a
horse, and paid his price, $95.00 for a horse,
but Major Thompson, being of a timid nature,
was afraid that too many horsemen might
attract attention, refused to let me ride by the
wagon-road, so Mr. Parson said there was a
mountain path that I could follow that would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
lead in the big road some few miles beyond, but
that I would have to lead the animal for about
a couple of miles, when I would be able to ride.
Dr. Whitaker, a worthy member of my Company,
and a good companion, offered me his services
to get the animal over the roughest part
of the route. I accepted his offer, and promised
that we would ride by turns, so I took the horse
by the bridle and led him, Whitaker following
behind, coaxing him along. The mountain was
so steep I had to talk to keep the horse on his
feet, but nevertheless he slipped several times
and we worried to get him up again. We made
slow headway; the column had advanced, and
we lost sight of it, and were left alone, worrying
with the horse, who finally lost foothold again,
and rolled over. The writer was forced to
turn loose the bridle to keep from being dragged
along into the hollow. The horse rolled over
and over, making every effort to gain his feet,
but to no avail, until he reached the bottom,
where he appeared no bigger than a goat. I
felt sorry for the poor animal, so I went down,
took off his saddle and bridle, placed them on
a rock, and left him to take care of himself. I
rejoined Dr. Whitaker. Relieved of our burden,
we followed the trail made by the column.
About sunset we caught sight of them, just as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
they crossed Green Brier River, a wide, but
shallow stream. At that place the water was
waist deep in the center, running very swift, as
mountain streams do, over slippery moss-covered
rocks. When center of the river, I lost
foot hold and the stream, swift as it was, swept
me under, and in my feeble condition I had a
struggle to recover myself. I lost my rations,
which were swept down stream, a great loss to
me, but undoubtedly served as a fine repast for
the fishes which abounded in those waters.</p>

<p>The column continued its line of march, passing
a settlement, the first dwelling I had seen
in five days. I called at the gate; receiving no
answer, I walked into the porch; the door being
ajar, I pushed it open and found an empty room,
with the exception of a wooden bench, and an
old-fashioned, home-made primitive empty bedstead,
with cords serving to support the bedding
that the owners had hurriedly removed before
our arrival. I called again. Presently a young
woman presented herself. After passing greetings
of the day I asked, "Where are the folks?"
She said, "They are not here," (the surroundings
indicated a hasty exit). I said, "So I see.
Where are they?" She said she did not know,
undoubtedly not willing to divulge. "Who lives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
here?" "Mr. Snider." "And you don't know
where he is?" "No, he heard you all were coming,
and not being in sympathy with you all, he
left." "Well, he ought not to have done so,
nobody would have harmed him or hurt a hair
on his head. He is entitled to his opinion, as
long as he does not take up arms against us."
So I recounted the accident that had befallen
me, and wanted to replenish my provisions.
I asked if I could buy something to eat. She
said, "There are no provisions in the house",
"Well, I hope you would not object to my making
a fire in this fire-place to dry myself." She
said she had no objection. It must be remembered
that the fire-places in those days were
very roomy indeed. I found wood on the woodpile,
and soon had a roaring fire. It was late
in the evening, and I intended to pass that night
under shelter, for I was chilled to the bone. In
moving the bench in front of the fire, on which
to spread my jacket to dry, I noticed a pail covered,
and full of fresh milk, "Well, you can
sell me some of that milk, can't you?" She
said, "You can have all you want for nothing."
I thanked her and said I wish I had some meal
and I could well make out. She said, "I will
see if I can find any", and presently she
returned with sufficient to make myself a large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
hoe-cake. I baked the same on an old shovel.
While it was baking my clothes were drying on
my body, affording a luxuriant steam bath. I
had a tin cup. I drank some of the milk and had
a plentiful repast. I handed her a quarter of a
dollar to pay for the meal, which she accepted
with some hesitancy. All at once the girl disappeared
and left me in charge. It was most
dark, when someone hollowed at the gate; recognizing
the voices, I found them to be two men
of my Company, viz., G. A. Tarbutton and J. A.
Roberson. I met them and invited them in.
To tell the truth, I did not much like the mysterious
surroundings of those premises, especially
as the girl asked me not to divulge that she
let me have some meal.</p>

<p>My comrades and self took in the situation;
we conferred with one another and agreed to
spend the night under shelter in a warm room,
a luxury not enjoyed in some time and not to
be abandoned. They had informed me that the
Column had encamped less than a quarter of a
mile beyond and they had returned to this place
in search of some Apple Jack. We concluded
to take it by turns, while two of us are asleep,
the third will stand guard and keep up the fire,
for the reader must know that notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the season, the nights were very cold in those
mountain regions and were especially so with
wet garments on.</p>

<p>The following morning my comrades left, but
before leaving we disposed of the milk in the
pail. I remained in the hope of again seeing
my charming hostess, and induce her to sell me
some provisions for my journey along. I saw
in the woods, some old hens scratching, and I
thought I might persuade her to sell me one.
Presently she came with a plate of ham, chicken
and biscuits which she offered me. I accepted,
and not wishing to embarrass her, did not ask
any questions. Presently, old man Snider
appeared. He was a fine looking specimen of
manhood, had a ruddy complexion and appeared
physically Herculean. After exchanging a little
commonplace talk, he followed me to where
the boys camped. He was seemingly astonished
to see so many gentlemen among the so-called
savage rebels. I asked him if he could induce
his daughter to bake me a chicken, he answered,
"I suppose I could." "What will it be worth?"
"Half a dollar" he guessed. I gave him the
money and he said he would bring me the
chicken, which he did, and it was a fine one, well
cooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p>The people in that thinly populated section of
the country lived a very primitive life, they
were mostly ignorant. They did their own work,
had plenty to live on, owned no negroes and
were very kind-hearted after you got acquainted.
They had strange notions about the Rebels,
thinking we were terrible fellows. The original
settlers of Northwestern Virginia were
Dutch, a very simple and hard-working honest
people.</p>

<p>At about three o'clock in the afternoon, having
had a long rest, we again took up the line of
march by short stages, still under the guidance
of one of our guides, and from that day on, we
continued our march, passing Cheat Mountain,
Allegheny Mountains, until finally we reached
McDowell. Coming down Cheat Mountain, the
boys were treated to a strange sight, especially
those who were raised in a low country and who
had never seen any mountains, for in those days
there was not much traveling done, and the
majority of the people did not often venture
away from their homes.</p>

<p>The little village of Huttensville lies just at
the foot of Cheat Mountain, a mountain of great
altitude. The houses below us did not appear
to be larger than bird cages, but plainly in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
view, first to the right and then to the left, as
the pike would tack, the mountain being very
steep. It was a lovely day, the sun had risen in
all its splendor, when as if by magic, our view
below us was obscured by what seemed to be a
very heavy fog, and we lost sight of the little
village. Still the sun was shining warm, and as
we were going down hill it was easy going, and
as we approached the village, the veil that had
obscured our view lifted itself and the people
reported to have experienced one of the heaviest
storms in their lives, the proof of which we
noticed in the mud and washouts which were
visible, while we who were above the clouds did
not receive a single drop.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<p>At McDowell we formed a reunion with the
rest of our forces, who in their flight made a
long detour, passing through a portion of Maryland
adjoining that part of West Virginia. The
following evening we had dress parade and the
Adjutant's report of those who were missing.
The writer does not remember the entire casualties
of that affair, but found that his little
squad of twenty-one were all present or accounted
for.</p>

<p>My friend, Eagle, from whom we hired teams
to carry us to Laurel Hill was present and he
came to shake hands with me while we were in
line; he was glad to see me. A general order to
disband the regiment for ten days was read, in
order to enable the men to seek the needed rest.
Mr. Eagle came to me at once, saying, "I take
care of you and your friends, the twenty-one
that I hauled to Laurel Hill, at my house. It
shall not cost you a cent", a most generous and
acceptable offer. I called for my Davisboro
fellows, and followed Mr. Eagle to his home,
where he entertained us in a most substantial
manner. He was a man well-to-do, an old bachelor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
The household consisted of himself and
two spinster sisters, all between forty and fifty
years of age; and a worthy mother in the seventies,
also a brother who was a harmless lune,
roving at will and coming home when he pleased,
a very inoffensive creature; his name was Chris.
The mother, although for years in that country,
still could not talk the English language. Untiringly
and seemingly in the best of mood,
they performed their duties in preparing meals
for that hungry army. Chris got kinder mystified
to see so many strangers in the house. He
walked about the premises all day, saying,
"Whoo-p-e-ee Soldiers fighting against the
war", and no matter what you asked him, his
reply was, "Whoo-o-p-e-ee, Soldiers fighting
against the war-ha-ha-ha-ha!"</p>

<p>At the expiration of the ten days leave, we
bade our host good-bye. We wanted to remunerate
him, at least in part, for all of his trouble
in our behalf, but he would not receive the least
remuneration, saying, "I am sorry I could not
have done more." We rendezvoused in the town,
but a great many were missing on account of
sickness, the measles of a very virulent nature
having broken out among the men, and many
succumbed from the disease. We were ordered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
back to Monterey and went into camp. The measles
still continued to be prevalent and two of my
Davisboro comrades died of it, viz., John Lewis
and Noah Turner, two as clever boys as ever
were born. I felt very sad over the occurrence.
Their bodies were sent home and they were
buried at New Hope Church.</p>

<p>General R. E. Lee, rode up one day, and we
were ordered in line for inspection, he was riding
a dapple gray horse. He looked every inch
a soldier. His countenance had a very paternal
and kind expression. He was clean shaven,
with the exception of a heavy iron gray mustache.
He complimented us for our soldiery
bearing. He told Captain Jones that he never
saw a finer set of men. We camped at Monterey
for a month. During all this time, when
the people at home became aware of our disaster,
they at once went to work to make up uniforms
and other kinds of wearing apparels.
Every woman that could ply a needle exerted
herself, and before we left Monterey for Green
Brier, Major Newman, who always a useful and
patriotic citizen, made his appearance among
the boys, with the product of the patriotic
women of Washington County. Every man was
remembered munificently, and it is due to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
good women of the county that we were all comfortably
shod and clothed to meet the rigorous
climate of a winter season in that wild region.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<p>While still in camps at Monterey, the Fourteenth
Georgia Regiment, on their way to Huntersville,
with a Company of our County, under
command of Captain Bob Harmon, encamped
close to us. The boys were glad to meet and
intermingled like brothers. A day or so after
we were ordered to move to Green Brier at the
foot of the Allegheny and Cheat Mountains, the
enemy occupying the latter, under general Reynolds.</p>

<p>Our picket lines extended some three miles
beyond our encampment, while the enemy's also
extended to several miles beyond their encampment,
leaving a neutral space unoccupied by
either forces. Often reconnoitering parties
would meet beyond the pickets and exchange
shots, and often pickets were killed at their
posts by an enemy slipping up through the
bushes unaware to the victim. I always considered
such as willful murder.</p>

<p>It became my time to go on picket; the post
assigned to me was on the banks of the River,
three miles beyond our camps. The night before
one of our men was shot from across the River.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Usually three men were detailed to perform
that duty, so that they can divide watch every
two hours, one to guard and two to sleep, if such
was possible. On that occasion the guard was
doubled and six men were detailed, and while
four lay on the ground in blankets, two were on
the lookout. The post we picked out was under
a very large oak; in our immediate rear was a
corn field the corn of which was already appropriated
by the cavalry. The field was surrounded
by a low fence and the boys at rest lay
in the fence corners. It was a bright starlight
September night, no moon visible, but one could
distinguish an object some distance beyond. I
was on the watch. It was about eleven P. M.,
when through the still night, I heard foot-steps
and the breaking of corn stalks. I listened
intently, and the noise ceased. Presently I
heard it again; being on the alert, and so was
my fellow-watchman, we cautiously awoke the
men who were happy in the arms of Morpheus,
not even dreaming of any danger besetting
their surroundings. I whispered to them to get
ready quietly, that we heard the approach of
someone walking in our front. The guns which
were in reach beside them were firmly grasped.
We listened and watched, in a stooping position,
when the noise started again, yet a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>more pronounced and closer. We were ready
to do our duty. I became impatient at the delay,
and not wishing to be taken by surprise, I
thought I would surprise somebody myself, so
took my musket at a trail, crept along the fence
to reconnoiter, while my comrades kept their
position. When suddenly appeared ahead of
me a white object, apparently a shirt bosom. I
cocked my gun, but my target disappeared, and
I heard a horse snorting. On close inspection,
I found that it was a loose horse grazing, and
what I took for a shirt bosom was his pale face,
which sometimes showed, when erect, then disappeared
while grazing. I returned and reported,
to the great relief of us all. Heretofore,
men on guard at the outpost would fire their
guns on hearing any unusual noise and thus
alarming the army, which at once would put
itself in readiness for defense, only to find out
that it was a false alarm and that they were
needlessly disturbed. Such occurrences happened
too often, therefore a general order was
read that any man that would fire his gun needlessly
and without good cause, or could not give
a good reason for doing so would be court-martialed
and dealt with accordingly. Therefore,
the writer was especially careful not to violate
these orders.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption"><br /><br />A Picket Shot While on Duty, Nothing
Short of Murder.</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>At another time it became again my lot to go
on vidette duty. This time it was three miles in
the opposite direction in the rear of the camp
in the Allegheny, in a Northwesterly direction,
in a perfect wilderness, an undergrowth of a
virgin forest. It was a very gloomy evening
the clouds being low. A continual mist was falling.
It was in the latter part of September. We
were placed in a depressed piece of ground surrounded
by mountains. The detail consisted of
Walker Knight, Alfred Barnes and myself. Corporal
Renfroe, whose duty was to place us in
position, gave us the following instructions and
returned to camp: "Divide your time as usual,
no fire allowed, shoot anyone approaching without
challenge." Night was falling fast, and in
a short while there was Egyptian darkness. We
could not even see our hands before our eyes.
There was a small spruce pine, the stem about
five inches in diameter, with its limbs just above
our heads. We placed ourselves under it as a
protection from the mist, and in case it would
rain. All at once, we heard a terrible yell, just
such as a wild cat might send forth, only many
times louder. This was answered it seemed
like, from every direction. Barnes remarked
"What in the world is that?" I said, "Panthers,
it looks like the woods are full of them." The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
panthers, from what we learned from inhabitants
are dangerous animals, and often attack
man, being a feline species, they can see in the
dark. I said, "There is no sleep for us, let us
form a triangle, back to back against this tree,
so in case of an attack, we are facing in every
direction." Not being able to see, our guns and
bayonets were useless, and we took our pocket
knives in hand in case of an attack at close
quarters. The noise of these beasts kept up a
regular chorus all night long, and we would have
preferred to meet a regiment of the enemy than
to be placed in such a position. We were all
young and inexperienced. I was the oldest, and
not more than twenty-three years old. Walker
Knight said, "Boys, I can't stand it any longer,
I am going back to camp." I said, "Walker,
would you leave your post to be court-martialed,
and reported as a coward? Then, you
would not find the way back, this dark night,
and be torn up before you would get there.
Here, we can protect each other." Occasionally
we heard dry limbs on the ground, crack,
as if someone walking on them. This was rather
close quarters to be comfortable, especially
when one could not see at all. There we stood,
not a word was spoken above a whisper, when
we heard a regular snarl close by, then Barnes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
said, "What is that?" I said, "I expect it is a
bear." All this conversation was in the lowest
whisper; to tell the truth, it was the worst night
I ever passed, and my friend Knight, even now
says that he could feel his hair on his head stand
straight up.</p>

<p>My dear reader, don't you believe we were
glad when day broke on us? It was seemingly
the longest night I ever spent, and so say my
two comrades.</p>

<p>The country from Monterey to Cheat Mountain
was not inhabited, with the exception of a
tavern on top of the Allegheny, where travelers
might find refreshments for man and
beast. The enemy often harassed us with
scouting parties, and attacking isolated posts.
To check these maneuvres, we did the same;
so one evening, Lieutenant Dawson of the
Twelfth Georgia Regiment, Captain Willis
Hawkins' Company from Sumter County, and
which regiment formed a contingent part of our
forces at Green Brier River, came to me saying,
"Hermann, I want you tonight." He was
a fearless scout, a kind of warfare that suited
his taste, and he always called on me on such
occasions. And after my last picket experience,
I was only too willing to go with him, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
relieved me from army duty the day following,
and I preferred that kind of excitement to standing
guard duty.</p>

<p>We left at dark, and marched about four
miles, towards the enemy's camp to Cheat River,
a rather narrow stream to be a river. A wooden
bridge spanned the stream. We halted this
side. On our right was a steep mountain, the
turn pike or road rounded it nearly at its base.
The mountain side was covered with flat loose
rocks of all sizes, averaging all kinds of thickness.
By standing some on their edge, and propping
them with another rock, afforded fine protection
against minnie balls. In this manner
we placed ourselves in position behind this improvised
breastworks.</p>

<p>The mot d'ordre was not to fire until the command
was given. We were ten in number, and
the understanding was to fire as we lay, so as to
hit as many as possible. At about ten o'clock
P. M. we heard the enemy crossing the bridge,
their horses's hoofs were muffled so as to make
a noiseless crossing, and take our pickets by surprise.
They came within fifty yards of us and
halted in Column. Lieutenant Dawson commanded
the man next to him to pass it up the
line to make ready to shoot, when he commanded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
in a loud voice, "Fire!" Instantly, as per one
crack of a musket, all of us fired, and consternation
reigned among the enemy's ranks; those
that could get away stampeded across the bridge.
We did not leave our position until day. When
we saw the way was clear, we gathered them
up, took care of the wounded and buried the
dead&mdash;several of our shots were effective. On
the 3rd of October, they made an attack on us
in full force, and while they drove in our pickets,
we had ample time to prepare to give them
a warm reception.</p>

<p>The following is a description of the battle
ground and a description of our forces:</p>

<p>On the extreme right, in an open meadow,
not far from the banks of the river, was the
First Georgia Regiment, lying flat on the
grass; to the immediate left and rear was a battery
of four guns, on a mount immediately confronting
the turn pike, and fortified by breastworks,
and supported by the Forty-fourth Virginia
Regiment, commanded by Colonel Scott;
further to left, across the road was a masked
battery, with abatis in front, Captain Anderson
commanding, and supported by the Third
Arkansas Regiment and the Twelfth Georgia
Regiment, commanded by Colonels Rusk and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Johnston respectively. As the enemy came
down the turn pike, the battery on our left, commanding
that position, opened on them, the
enemy from across the river responded with
alacrity, and there was a regular artillery duel
continuously. Their infantry filed to their left,
extending their line beyond that of the First
Georgia, they followed the edge of the stream
at the foot of the mountain. We detached two
Companies from the Regiment further to our
right, to extend our line. They were not more
than two hundred yards in front. The balance
of the regiment lay low in its position; the order
was to shoot low, and not before we could see
the white of their eyes.</p>

<p>The enemy would fire on us continually, but
the balls went over us and did no damage.
While maneuvring thus on our right, they made
a vigorous attack on Anderson's battery, but
were repulsed with heavy loss. Late in the
afternoon they withdrew. Our casualties were
very small, and that of the enemy considerable.</p>

<p>Colonel Ramsey, who, early that morning went
out on an inspection tour, dismounted for some
cause, his horse came into camp without a rider,
and we gave him up for lost, but later, a little
before dark, he came in camp, to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
rejoicing of the regiment, for we all loved him.
General Henry R. Jackson was our commander
at that time, and soon afterwards was transferred
South.</p>

<p>The enemy had all the advantage by the superiority
of their arms, while ours were muzzle
loaders, carrying balls but a very short distance;
theirs were long range, hence we could
not reach them only at close quarters. A very
amusing instant was had during their desultory
firing. The air was full of a strange noise; it
did not sound like the hiss of a minnie-ball, nor
like that of a cannon ball. It was clearly audible
all along the line of the First Georgia; the
boys could not help tucking their heads. The
next day some of the men picked up a ram rod
at the base of a tree where it struck broadside,
and curved into a half circle. It was unlike any
we had, and undoubtedly the fellow forgot to
draw it out of the gun, fired it at us, and this
was the strange sound we heard which made us
dodge. A few nights later, a very dark night,
we sent out a strong detachment, under Command
of Colonel Talliaferro to cut off their
pickets, which extended to Slavins Cabin (an
old abandoned log house). To cross the river
we put wagons in the run; a twelve inch plank
connected the wagons and served as a bridge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
On the other side of the river was a torch bearer,
holding his torch so that the men could see how
to cross. The torch blinded me, and instead of
looking ahead, I looked down. It seemed that
the men with the torch shifted the light, casting
the shadow of a connecting plank to the right,
when instead of stepping on the plank, I stepped
on the shadow, and down in the water I went
(rather a cold bath in October) and before
morning, my clothing was actually frozen. In
crossing Cheat River Bridge, the road tacked to
the left, making a sudden turn, which ran parallel
with the same road under it. The head of
the column having reached there, the rear thinking
them to be enemies, fired into them. Haply
no one was hurt before the mistake was discovered,
but the enemy got notice of our approach
by the firing, and had withdrawn, so the expedition
was for naught. We were back in camp
about eight o'clock the following morning.</p>

<p>At the latter end of the month Colonel
Edward Johnson concluded to attack General
Reynolds in his stronghold on Cheat Mountain.</p>

<p>The Third Arkansas Regiment, under command
of Colonel Rusk, was detached and sent to
the rear, taking a long detour a couple of days
ahead, and making demonstrations, while the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
main force would attack them in front. Colonel
Rusk was to give the signal for attack. Early
in the night we sent out a large scouting party
to attack their pickets, and drive them in. Lieutenant
Dawson was in command. Early that
day we started with all the forces up Cheat
Mountain, a march of twelve miles. During the
progress of our march the advance guard having
performed what was assigned them to do,
returned by a settlement road running parallel
with the turn pike for some distance, when of
a sudden, balls were hissing among us and some
of the men were hit. The fire was returned at
once, and flanker drawn out whose duty it was
to march on the flank of the column, some
twenty paces by its side, keeping a sharp lookout.
I mistook the order, and went down into
the woods as a scout, the firing still going on,
and I was caught between them both. I hugged
close to the ground keeping a sharp lookout to
my right. When I recognized the Company's
uniform, and some of my own men, I hollowed
at them to stop firing, that they were shooting
our own men, when they hollowed, "Hurrah for
Jeff Davis," when from above, Colonel Johnson
responded, "Damn lies, boys, pop it to
them," when Weaver Jones stuck a white handkerchief
on his bayonet and the firing ceased.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Sergeant P. R. Talliaferro was hit in the breast
by a spent ball. Weaver had a lock of his hair
just above his ear cut off as though it had been
shaved off. One man was wounded and bled to
death, another was wounded and recovered.
Such mistakes happened often in our lines for
the lack of sound military knowledge.</p>

<p>The man that bled to death was from the
Dahlonega Guards. He said while dying, that
he would not mind being killed by an enemy's
bullet, but to be killed by his own friends is too
bad. Everything was done that could be done
for the poor fellow, but of no avail.</p>

<p>The column advanced to a plateau, overlooking
the enemy's camp. We placed our guns in
battery, waiting for the Rusk signal, which was
never given; we waited until four o'clock P. M.
and retraced our steps without firing a gun.
We saw their lines of fortification and their
flags flying from a bastion, but not a soul was
visible. We thought Reynolds had given us the
slip and that we would find him in our rear and
in our camp before we could get back, so we
double quicked at a fox trot, until we reached
our quarters in the early part of the night.</p>

<p>Colonel Rusk came in two days afterward,
and reported that his venture was impracticable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Cold winter was approaching with rapid strides
and rations were not to the entire satisfaction
of our men. The beef that was issued to us,
although very fine, had become a monotonous
diet, and the men longed for something else,
they had become satiated with it, so I proposed
to Captain Jones that if he would report me
accounted for in his report, that I would go
over to Monterey and McDowell on a foraging
expedition, and bring provisions for the Company.
He said he would, but I must not get
him into trouble, for the orders were that no
permits be issued for anyone to leave camp and
that all passes, if any be issued, must be countersigned
by Captain Anderson, who was
appointed Commander of the post. We still
were without tents for they were captured by
the enemy at Carricks Ford, and we sheltered
ourselves the best we could with the blankets
we had received from home. The snow had
fallen during the night to the depth of eight
inches, and it was a strange sight to see the
whole camp snowed under, (literally speaking).
When morning approached, the writer
while not asleep, was not entirely aroused. He
lay there under his blanket, a gentle perspiration
was oozing from every pore of his skin,
when suddenly, he aroused himself, and rose up.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Not a man was to be seen, the hillocks of snow,
however, showed where they lay, so I hollowed,
"look at the snow." Like jumping out of the
graves, the men pounced up in a jiffy, they were
wrestling and snowballing and rubbing each
other with it. After having performed all the
duties devolving upon me that afternoon, I
started up the Allegheny where some members
of my Company with others, were detailed,
building winter quarters. Every carpenter in
the whole command was detailed for that
purpose.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<p>When some three miles beyond camps, I
noted a little smoke arising as I approached. I
noted that it was the outpost. My cap was covered
with an oil cloth, and I had an overcoat
with a cape, such as officers wore; hence the
guard could not tell whether I was a private,
corporal or a general. I noticed that they had
seen me approach. One of them advanced to the
road to challenge me, but I spoke first. I knew
it was against the orders to have a fire at the
outpost on vidette duty so I said, "Who told you
to have a fire? Put out that fire, sirs, don't you
know it is strictly prohibited?"&mdash;"What is your
name&mdash;what Company do you belong to, and
what is your regiment?" all of which was
answered. I took my little note book and pencil,
and made an entry, or at least made a bluff
in this direction, and said, "You'll hear from me
again." I had the poor fellow scared pretty
badly, and they never even made any demand
on me to find out who I was. They belonged
to Colonel Scott's regiments. The bluff worked
like a charm, and I marched on. When about
six miles from camp, I was pretty tired, walking
in the snow and up-hill. I saw General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Henry R. Jackson, and Major B. L. Blum, coming
along in a jersey wagon. The General
asked me where I was going,&mdash;it was my time
to get a little scared. I answered that I was
going on top the Allegheny where they built
winter quarters. "Get in the wagon, you can
ride, we are going that way." I thanked them;
undoubtedly the General thought that I was
detailed to go there and to assist in that work.
This is the last I saw of General Jackson in
that country.</p>

<p>Among the men I found Tom Tyson, Richard
Hines, William Roberson (surnamed "Crusoe").
I spent the night with them in a cabin
they had built and the following morning I
took an early start down the mountain toward
Monterey. It had continued to snow all the
night and it lay to the depth of twelve inches.
I could only follow the road by the opening distance
of the tree tops, and which sometimes was
misleading. I passed the half-way house,
known as the tavern, about 9 o'clock A. M.
Four hundred yards beyond, going in an oblique
direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, I saw
a large bear going through the woods; he was
a fine specimen, his fur was as black as coal. I
approximate his size as about between three
hundred and four hundred pounds. He turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
his head and looked at me and stopped. I at
once halted, bringing my musket to a trail. I
was afraid to fire for fear of missing my mark,
my musket being inaccurate, so I reserved my
fire for closer quarters, the bear being at least
fifty yards from me, and he followed his course
in a walk. I was surprised and said to myself,&mdash;"Old
fellow, if you let me alone, I surely will
not bother you."</p>

<p>I watched him 'till he was out of my sight.
My reason for not shooting him was two-fold;
first, I was afraid I might miss him, and my gun
being a muzzle loader, the distance between us
was too short, and he would have been on me
before I could have reloaded, so I reserved my
fire, expecting to get in closer proximity. I was
agreeably surprised when he continued his journey.
When I came to Monterey that afternoon,
I told some of its citizens what a narrow escape
I had. They smiled and said "Bears seldom
attack human, unless in very great extremities,
but I did well not to have shot unless I was sure
that I would have killed him, for a wounded
bear would stop the flow of blood with his fur,
by tapping himself on the wound, and face
his antagonist, and I could have been sure he
would have gotten the best of me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>From Monterey I went over to McDowell,
fourteen miles, to see my friend Eagle and his
brother-in-law, Sanders, he that made the
twelve Yankees run by running in front of
them. I stated my business and invoked their
assistance, which they cheerfully extended. In
about three days, we had about as much as a
four horse team could pull.</p>

<p>Provisions sold cheap. One could buy a fine
turkey for fifty cents, a chicken for fifteen to
twenty cents, butter twelve and one-half cents
and everything else in proportion. Apples were
given me for the gathering of them. Bacon
and hams for seven to eight cents per pound, the
finest cured I ever tasted.</p>

<p>The people in these regions lived bountifully,
and always had an abundance to spare. Mr.
Eagle furnished the team and accompanied me
to camp, free of charge. Money was a scarce
article at that time among the boys; the government
was several months in arrear with our
pay, but we expected to be paid off daily, so
Mr. Eagle said he would be responsible to the
parties that furnished the provisions, and the
Company could pay him when we got our
money; he was one of the most liberal and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
patriotic men that it was my pleasure to meet
during the war.</p>

<p>Four days later, Captain Jones received our
money. I kept a record of all the provisions
furnished to each man, and the captain deducted
the amount from each. I wrote Eagle to
come up and get his money; he came, and
received every cent that was due him.</p>

<p>But I must not omit an incident that occurred
when near our camp with the load of provisions.
I had to pass hard by the Twelfth Georgia Regiment,
which was camped on the side of the
turn pike, when some of the men who were as
anxious for a change of diet as we were, came to
me and proposed to buy some of my provisions.
I stated that they were sold and belonged to
Company E, First Regiment, and that I could
not dispose of them. Some Smart-Aleks, such
as one may find among any gathering of men,
proposed to charge the wagon and appropriate
its contents by force. Seeing trouble ahead, I
drew my pistol, when about a dozen men ran out
with their guns. Eagle turned pale, he thought
his time had come, when a Lieutenant interfered,
asking the cause of the disturbance,
which I stated. He said, "Men, none of that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
back with those guns." He mounted the wagon
and accompanied us to my camp, which was a
few hundred yards beyond.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<p>Once later, I was called out for fatigue duty.
I said, "Corporal, what is to be done?" He
answered, "To cut wood for the blacksmith
shop." I replied, "You had better get someone
else who knows how, I never cut a stick in
my life," he said, "You are not too old to learn
how." This was conclusive, so he furnished me
with an axe, and we marched into the woods,
and he said he would be back directly with a
wagon to get the wood and he left me. I was
looking about me to find a tree, not too large,
one that I thought I could manage. I spied a
sugar maple about eight inches in diameter. I
sent my axe into it, but did not take my cut
large enough to reach the center, when it came
down to a feather edge and I did not have judgment
enough to know how to enlarge my cut by
cutting from above, so I started a new cut from
the right, another from the left, bringing the
center to a pivot of about three inches in diameter,
as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar; finally,
by continuous hacking, I brought it to a point
where I could push it back and forth. The
momentum finally broke the center, but in place
of falling, the top lodged in a neighboring tree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and I could not dislodge it. I worked hard, the
perspiration ran down my face, my hands were
lacerated, I finally got mad, and sent the axe
a-glimmering, and it slid under the snow. After
awhile my corporal came for the wood; "Where
is the wood?" I showed him the tree; "Is that
all you have done?" I could not restrain any
longer, I said, "Confound you, I told you I did
not know anything about cutting wood."
"Where is the axe?" We looked everywhere
but could not find it; it must have slid under the
snow and left no trace, so he arrested me and
conducted me before Colonel Edward Johnson,
a West Pointer, in command of the post. He
was at his desk writing; turning to face us, he
addressed himself to me, who stood there, cap
in hand, while the Corporal stood there with
his kept on his head. "What can I do for you?"
I said, looking at the Corporal. "He has me
under arrest and brought me here." Looking
at the corporal the Colonel said, "Pull off your
hat, sir, when you enter officers' quarters." (I
would not have taken a dollar for that). The
Corporal pulled off his cap. "What have you
arrested him for?" The Corporal answered
that I was regularly detailed to cut wood for the
blacksmith shop, and that I failed to do my duty,
and lost the axe he furnished me. "Why did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
you not cut the wood?" said the Colonel. "I
tried," said I, "I told him that I had never cut
any wood and did not know how; where I came
from there are no woods. Look at my hands."
They were badly blistered and lacerated. The
Colonel cursed out the Corporal as an imbecile,
for not getting someone who was used to such
work. I told the Colonel how hard I had tried
and what I had done. The Colonel smiled and
said, "What did you do with the axe?";
"When the tree lodged and I could not budge
it, I got mad and made a swing or two with the
axe, and let her slide; it must have slid under
the snow, and we could not find it." "What
have you done for a living?" "After I quit
school, I clerked in a store." "Can you write?"
"Oh, yes!" "Let me see." "My hand is too
sore and hurt now." "Well, come around tomorrow,
I may get you a job here."</p>

<p>Next day I called at his quarters, and he put
me to copying some documents and reports,
which I did to his satisfaction. I had warm
quarters and was relieved from camp duties for
a little while.</p>

<p>This brings us to about the middle of December,
and we were ordered to Winchester. Colonel
Johnson with his Regiment and a small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
force, was left in charge of the Winter Quarters
on the Allegheny, so I took leave of him to join
my Company.</p>

<p>Colonel Johnson, while a little brusk in his
demeanor, was a clever, social gentleman, and
a good fighter, which he proved to be when the
enemy made a night descent on him and took
him by surprise. He rallied his men, barefooted
in the snow, knee-deep, thrashed out the enemy
and held the fort; he was promoted to General
and was afterwards known as the Allegheny
Johnson.</p>

<p>My Command having preceded me, I went to
Staunton, where I met J. T. Youngblood, Robert
Parnelle and others from my Company. I
also met Lieutenant B. D. Evans of my Company,
just returned from a visit from home.
We took the stage coach from Stanton to Winchester
through Kanawah Valley. We passed
Woodstock, Strasburg, New Market, Middletown,
and arrived at Winchester in due time.
General T. J. Jackson in command, we had a
splendid camp about a mile to the left of the
city. The weather had greatly moderated and
the snow was melting. The regiment had received
tents to which we built chimneys with flat
rocks that were abundant all around us. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
flour barrels served as chimney stacks, and we
were comfortable; rations were also good and
plentiful, but hardly were we installed when we
received orders to strike camps. The men were
greatly disappointed; we expected to be permitted
to spend winter there. We took up the line
of march late in the evening, marched all night
and struck Bath early in the morning, took the
enemy by surprise while they were fixing their
morning meal, which they left, and the boys
regaled themselves. The Commissary and
Quartermaster also left a good supply behind
in their rapid flight, and we appropriated many
provisions, shoes, blankets and overcoats; from
Bath we marched to Hancock, whipped out a
small force of the enemy, and continued our
force to Romney where we struck camps.
Romney is a small town situated on the other
side of the Potomac River. General Jackson
demanded the surrender of the place, the
enemy refused, so he ordered the non-combatants
to leave, as he would bombard the town.
Bringing up a large cannon which we called
"Long Tom" owing to its size, he fired one
round and ordered us to fall back. All this was
during Christmas week.</p>

<p>On our return it turned very cold and sleeted;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the road became slick and frozen, and not being
prepared for the emergency, I saw mules,
horses and men take some of the hardest falls,
as we retraced our steps, the road being down
grade. This short campaign was a success and
accomplished all it intended from a military
standpoint, although we lost many men from
exposure; pneumonia was prevalent among
many of our men. We have now returned to
Winchester. The writer himself, at that time,
thought that this campaign was at a great sacrifice
of lives from hardships and exposures, but
later on, learned that it was intended as a check
to enable General Lee in handling his forces
against an overwhelming force of the enemy,
and being still reinforced and whose battle cry
still was "On to Richmond." It was for this
reason that General "Stonewall" Jackson
threatened Washington via Romney and the
enemy had to recall their reinforcements
intended against General Lee to protect Washington.</p>

<p>The men from the Southern States were not
used to such rigorous climate and many of our
men had to succumb from exposure. My Company
lost three men from pneumonia, viz:&mdash;Sam
and Richard Hines, two splendid soldiers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and brothers, and Lorenzo Medlock. The writer
also was incapacitated. There were no preparations
in Winchester for such contingencies,
so the churches were used as hospitals. The
men were packed in the pews wrapped in their
blankets, others were lying on the nasty humid
floor, for it must be remembered that the streets
in Winchester were perfect lobbies of dirt and
snow tramped over by men, horses and vehicles.
While there in that condition I had the good
fortune to be noted by one of my regiment, he
was tall and of herculean form, his name was
Griswold, and while he and myself on a previous
occasion had some misunderstanding and
therefore not on speaking terms, he came to me
and extended his hand, saying: "Let us be
friends, we have hard times enough without
adding to it." I was too sick to talk, but
extended my hand, in token of having buried the
hatchet. He asked me if he could do anything
for me. I shook my head and shut my eyes. I
was very weak. When I opened them he was
gone. During the day he returned, saying:
"I found a better place for you at a private
house." He wrapped me in my blanket and
carried me on his shoulders a distance of over
three blocks. Mrs. Mandelbawm, the lady of the
house, had a nice comfortable room prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
for me, and Griswold waited on me like a
brother, he was a powerful man, but very overbearing
at times, but had a good heart. Mr.
Mandelbawm sent their family physician, who
prescribed for me. He pronounced me very
sick, he did not know how it might terminate.
It took all his efforts and my determination to
get well after three weeks struggling to accomplish
this end. My friend came to see me daily
when off duty.</p>

<p>The regiment's term of enlistment will soon
have expired, for we only enlisted for one year.
The regiment received marching order, not being
strong enough for duty. Through the recommendation
of my doctor and regimental color,
I was discharged and sent home. The regiment
had been ordered to Tennessee, but owing to a
wreck on the road they were disbanded at
Petersburg, Va., and the boys arrived home ten
days later than I.</p>

<p>In getting my transportation the Quartermaster
asked me to deliver a package to General
Beaureguard as I would pass via Manassas
Junction. When I arrived I inquired for his
quarters, when I was informed that he had left
for Centreville, I followed to that place, when
I was told he had left for Richmond. Arriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
at Richmond I went at once to the Executive
Department in quest of him and should I fail to
find him, would leave my package there, which
I did. This was on Saturday evening, I had not
a copper in money with me, but I had my pay
roll; going at once to the Treasury Department,
to my utter consternation, I found it closed. A
very affable gentlemen informed me that the
office was closed until Monday morning. I said,
"What am I to do, I have not a cent of money in
my pocket and no baggage," for at that time
hotels had adopted a rule that guests without
baggage would have to pay in advance. I
remarked that I could not stay out in the streets,
so the gentleman pulled a $10.00 bill out of his
pocket and handed it to me saying, "Will that
do you until Monday morning, 8 o'clock? When
the office will be open, everything will be all
right." I thanked him very kindly. Monday I
presented my bill which was over six months in
arrears. They paid it at once in Alabama State
bills, a twenty-five cent silver and two cents coppers.
I did not question the correctness of their
calculation. I took the money and went in quest
of my friend who so kindly advanced me the
$10.00. I found him sitting at a desk. He
was very busy. I handed him a $10.00 bill and
again thanked him for his kindness; he refused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
it saying: "Never mind, you are a long ways
from home and may need it." I replied that I
had enough to make out without it, I said that
I appreciated it, but didn't like to take presents
from strangers; he said, "We are no strangers,
my name is Juda P. Benjamin." Mr.
Benjamin was at that time Secretary of the
Treasury of the Confederate States. He was
an eminent lawyer from the State of Louisiana,
he became later on Secretary of War, and
when Lee surrendered he escaped to England
to avoid the wrath of the Federal Officials who
offered a premium for his capture. He became
Queen's Consul in England and his reputation
became international. No American who was
stranded ever appealed to him in vain, especially
those from the South. It is said of him
that he gave away fortunes in charity.</p>

<p>I came back to Georgia among my friends
who were proud to see me. Having no near
relations, such as father or mother, sisters or
brothers to welcome me, as had my comrades,
my friends all over the County took pride in
performing that duty, and thus ended my first
year's experience as a soldier in the war between
the States.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<p>Notwithstanding the arduous campaign and
severe hardships endured during my first year's
service, I did not feel the least depressed in
spirit or patriotism. On the contrary the arms
of the Confederacy in the main had proven themselves
very successful in repelling the enemy's
attacks and forcing that government continually
to call new levees to crush our forces in the
field.</p>

<p>Those measures on the part of our adversaries
appealed to every patriot at home and
regardless of hardships already endured. Hence
the First Georgia Regiment although disbanded
as an organization, the rank and file had sufficient
pluck to re-enter the service for the period
of the war regardless as to how long it might
last. Possessing some hard endured experience,
many of them organized commands of their
own, or joined other commands as subalterns or
commissioned officers.</p>

<p>The following is a roll of promotion from
the members of the Washington Rifles as first
organized.&mdash;See Appendix D.</p>

<p>The foregoing record proves that the Washington
Rifles were composed of men capable of
handling forces and that it had furnished men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
and officers in every branch of service in the
Confederate States Army, and had been active
after their return home from their first year's
experience in raising no little army themselves,
and what I have recorded of the Washington
Rifles may be written of every Company composing
the First Georgia Regiment.</p>

<p>The State of Georgia furnished more men
than any other State, and Washington County
furnished more Companies than any other
County in the State.</p>

<p>Such men cannot be denominated as rebels
or traitors, epithets that our enemies would fain
have heaped upon us. If the true history of
the United States as written before the war and
adopted in every school-house in the land,
North, South, East and West, did not demonstrate
them as patriots, ready and willing to
sacrifice all but honor on the altar of their
country.</p>

<p>On the first of May, 1862, Sergeant E. P.
Howell came to me saying: "Herman, how
would you like to help me make up an artillery
Company? I have a relative in South Carolina
who is a West Pointer and understands that
branch of the service. The Yankees are making
tremendous efforts for new levees and we,
of the South, have to meet them." "All right,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
said I, "I am tired after my experience with
infantry, having gone through with 'Stonewall's'
foot cavalry in his Romney campaign."
The following day we made a tour in the neighborhood
and enlisted a few of our old comrades
in our enterprise. We put a notice in the Herald,
a weekly paper edited by J. M. G. Medlock,
that on the 10th day of May we would meet in
Sandersville for organization, and then and
there we formed an artillery Company that
was to be known as the Sam Robinson Artillery
Company, in honor of an old and venerable
citizen of our County.</p>

<p>General Robinson, in appreciation of our having
named the Company in his honor presented
the organization with $1,000.00, which money
was applied in uniforming us.</p>

<p>The following members formed the composite
of said Company, and Robert Martin, known
as "Bob Martin" from Barnwell, S. C., was
elected Captain. See appendix E.</p>

<p>The writer was appointed bugler with rank
of Sergeant.</p>

<p>That night after supper, it being moon-light,
Mr. A. J. Linville a North Carolinian, a school
teacher boarding at my lodging proposed to
me as I performed on the flute, he being a violinist,
to have some music on the water. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
then explained that water is a conductor of
sound and that one could hear playing on it for
a long distance and music would sound a great
deal sweeter and more melodious than on land.
The Ogeechee River ran within a couple of hundred
yards from the house. There was on the
bank and close to the bridge a party of gentlemen
fishing, having a large camp fire and prepared
to have a fish-fry, so Linville and myself
took a boat that was moored above the bridge
and quietly, unbeknown to anybody paddled
about 1&frac14; mile up stream, expecting to float
down with the current. Although it was the
month of May the night was chilly enough for
an overcoat. Linville and myself struck up a
tune, allowing the boat to float along with the
current, the oar laying across my lap. Everything
was lovely, the moon was shining bright
and I enjoyed the novelty of the surroundings
and the music, when an over-hanging limb of a
tree struck me on the neck. Wishing to disengage
myself, I gave it a shove, and away went
the boat from under me and I fell backwards
into the stream in 12 feet of water. To gain the
surface I had to do some hard kicking, my boots
having filled with water and my heavy overcoat
kept me weighted down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>When reaching the surface after a hard struggle
my first observation was for the boat which
was about 50 yards below, Linville swinging to
a limb. I called him to meet me, and he replied
that he had no oar, that I kicked it out of the
boat. The banks on each side were steep and
my effecting a landing was rather slim. I spied
a small bush half-way up the embankment, I
made for it perfectly exhausted, I grabbed it,
the bank was too steep and slippery to enable
me to land, so I held on and rested and managed
to disembarrass myself of the overcoat
and told Linville to hold on, that I was coming.
I could not get my boots off, so I made an extra
effort to reach him anyhow, as the current would
assist me by being in my favor, so I launched
off. I reached the boat perfectly worn out. I
do not think I could have made another stroke.
After a little breathing spell and by a tremendous
effort I hoisted myself into the boat, but
not before it dipped some water.</p>

<p>On our way I picked up my discarded overcoat
and a piece of a limb which served as a
rudder to guide the boat to a successful landing,
and thus ended the music on the water.</p>

<p>We went to the house, changed our clothes
and returned, mingling with the fishermen and
kept all the fun we had to ourselves. They all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
made a fine catch and there was fish a plenty
for all. Linville and myself enjoyed the repast,
as the physical exercise we had just undergone
sharpened our appetite.</p>

<p>A few days later we rendezvoused at Sandersville,
and the Company left for Savannah, our
camp of instruction. Under the tuition of
Jacobi, leader of the band of the 32nd Georgia,
W. H. Harrison's Regiment, I soon learned all
the calls and commands.</p>

<p>While thus engaged the Company had a gross
misunderstanding with Capt. Martin, who,
before coming in contact with the members of
his command, was an entire stranger to them.
Most all were ignorant of military duties, but
strictly honest and patriotic citizens. Capt.
Martin was a strict disciplinarian and putting
the screws on rather a little too tight placed him
into disfavor with the men, who petitioned him
to resign, otherwise they would prefer charges
against him. Thus matters stood when I
returned to camp. Martin was tried before a
board and exonorated. To revenge himself
upon those who were active in his persecution
he reduced those that were non-commissioned
officers to ranks and appointed others in their
stead; and to make matters more galling,
appointed a substitute, a mercenary as orderly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Sergeant over a Company of volunteers, who
solely served their country through patriotism.
Ned Irwin, when elevated to the position he
was, proved himself a worthy tool in the hand
of his promoter. Men could not express an
opinion on hardly any subject without being
reported, he would sneak about in the dark,
crouch behind a tent evesdropping and make
report as unfavorably as he could to bring the
individual into disfavor. He made himself so
obnoxious that he did not have a friend in the
whole Company, and when he died at Yazoo
City, you could hear freely expressed the
following sentiment: "Poor old Ned is dead,
thank God this saves some good men of having
to kill him."</p>

<p>When I returned to camp I presented myself
before Capt. Martin who examined me as to my
proficiency as a bugler. I said, "Captain, there
has been quite some changes made since I have
been away," he said, "Yes, the men have
accused me of speculating on their rations." I
said I was very sorry that such a state of affairs
existed among officers and men, where harmony
ought to prevail; he said he insisted that those
charges be substantiated and demanded a court
martial, who on hearing the facts cleared him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of any criminality, so he punished the leaders
of the gang by reducing them to ranks.</p>

<p>Capt. Martin, however, proved himself a
capable officer in handling artillery and the men
finally came to love him on account of his efficiency
and fairness.</p>

<p>While in camp of instructions in Savannah,
the Government furnished us with six brass
pieces (2 Howitzer and 4 Napoleon) with the
necessary accoutrement and horses and we were
ordered to Bryan County in support of Fort
McAllister. We went into camp by the side of
the Ogeechee River, about three miles this side
of the Fort, which camp we named "Camp
McAllister." The fort was an earth structure,
strongly constructed with redoubts and parapets.
The magazine underground was strongly
protected by heavy timbers, and so was what
we called bomb-proof, for the men not actually
engaged, but who were ready to relieve those
who were, or became disabled under fire and
exposure, and compelled to be at their post of
duty. Short reliefs were necessary, for it is
hard work to manage heavy seige guns, but
the heaviest in that fort were only of forty-two
caliber. For some time nothing of importance
worth to chronicle happened; the boys attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to their regular camp life duty, roll calls and
drills; those off duty went fishing along the
river banks.</p>

<p>The country surrounding was low, flat,
marshy and replete with malarial fever, so
that we had to remove our camp several miles
further up the river, but still within close call
of the fort. This new camp was called "Camp
Arnold," in honor of Doctor Arnold, on whose
land we stationed. One morning I was ordered
to blow the call, only one man, Sergeant Cox,
reported. All the rest of the command were
down with chills and fever. There was no quinine
to be had, owing to the blockade, such
medicines being considered by our adversaries
as contraband of war. Men tried every remedy
possible, even drank cottonseed tea, at the suggestion
of a country physician by the name of
Dr. Turner, who pronounced it as a good substitute
(it was in taste if not in efficiency). The
writer was also stricken with the disease, and
was sent to Whitesville Hospital, about thirty
miles from Savannah on the Central of Georgia
Railroad. Dr. Whitehead was in charge of the
same, and Madam Cazzier and her daughter
from New Orleans were matrons. During my
fever spells I would rave sometimes and not
having been in this country over three years in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
all, my friends predominated over the English
language. Madam Cazzier, who spoke French
also, took a great interest in me; in fact, she
was strictly interested in all the patients, but
she seemed to be a little partial to myself, and
spent some time by my bedside when the fever
was off, and would tell me what I said during
my delirium. She nursed me and devoted on me
a motherly care, for which I shall always
remain thankful. My recuperation was rapid,
and I soon felt myself again.</p>

<p>One morning it was announced that General
Mercer of Savannah, and the Board of Inspectors
were to come on a round of inspection,
when we heard heavy firing, the sounds coming
from the east. Presently we heard that the
enemy with a large fleet was attacking Fort
McAllister. General Mercer and his Board had
come up from Savannah on a special train. He
called for all convalescent, able to fight to volunteer
to go to the front. I presented myself;
I was the only one. We cut loose the locomotive
and one car and went flying to Savannah at
the rate of a mile a minute, crossed the City in
a buss at full speed to the Gulf Depot, now
known as the S. F. &amp; W., just in time to board
the train to Way Station, twelve miles from
Savannah. An ambulance carried us to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Fort; the whole distance from the hospital to
the Fort was about fifty-two miles. We changed
conveyances three times and arrived at destination
in less than two hours. Capt. Martin was
in charge of a Mortar Detachment, so I
reported to him for duty, but my place had been
taken, and the detachment was complete, hence
he had no use for me. I learned that Major
Galley, the Commander of the Fort, had been
killed by the first shot from the enemy's guns,
which penetrated a sixteen foot embankment,
knocked off the left hand trunnion of a thirty-two
pounder, and struck the Major above the
ear, and took off the top of his head, so Captain
Anderson, of the Savannah Blues, took command.
Captain Martin sent me up the River to
a band about half a mile to the rear, which position
placed me at a triangle point to the Fort
and the gun boats. I was instructed to notice
the effect of our shots on the enemy's boats. I
kept tally sheets as to the hits between the belligerent
points. From my observation I counted
seventy-five hits by the guns of the Fort, and
one hundred and seventy-five hits by those of
the boats, which raised a cloud of dust equal to
an explosion of a mine. Their caliber being
three hundred and seventy-five pounders, and
fifteen inches in diameter, while our shots merely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
made a bright spot where they struck the heavy
armoured vessels and ricochet beyond. While
thus observing I noted a strange move of one of
the boats, suddenly I saw an immense flash, and
a splash in the river a couple of yards in front
of me. The water being very clear, we noted
a large projective at the bottom of the stream,
evidently aimed at me, as it was in direct line,
as I sat on my horse; undoubtedly they must
have taken me for a commanding officer and
thus paid me their res&mdash; I mean disrespect.</p>

<p>A concourse of people in the neighborhood
gathered to observe this unequal artillery duel
of five armoured gun boats and eleven wooden
mortar boats hidden behind a point below the
Fort, sending their projectiles like a shower of
aerolites into and around the Fort. Undaunted,
the boys stood by their guns, having the satisfaction
to notice one of the armoured vessels
break their line and floating down the River,
evidently having been struck in some vital part,
and thus placed hors de combat. This bombardment
continued from early morning until
near sundown, when the enemy withdrew, we
giving them parting shots as they steamed
down to their blockade station, lying in wait for
the Nashville, a blockade runner, who plyed
between Nassau, and any Confederate Port,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
which it might enter with goods, easily disposed
of at remunerative prices. The Fort was badly
dilapidated, our breastworks had been blown
to atoms, the guns exposed to plain view, all
port holes demolished, the barracks injured by
fire, which the boys extinguished while the battle
was raging; in fact, had a cyclone struck the
Fort in its full majestic force, it could not have
been worse. However, that night we pressed
into service all the negroes on the rice plantations.
Spades, shovels and pick axes were
handled with alacrity; baskets, bags and barrels
were filled, the enfeebled portions of the
Fort were reinforced by working like Trojans
all night long, and the Fort was again placed in
a presentable condition.</p>

<p>Early the following morning, when the enemy
again appeared, undoubtedly to take possession,
as the Fort would have been untenable in the
condition they left it the previous evening, we
opened fire on them, but they had seen what
had been done during the night, saw at once
that we were not disposed to give up; they withdrew
without even returning our fire, and the
boys would remark, they are treating us with
silent contempt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>For awhile we enjoyed repose and the luxuries
of the season at the Southern sea-coast,
hunting squirrels, rabbits and fishing, getting
leave of absence to visit home for a few days,
when one day the report reached us that the
enemy effected a landing at Killkanee, some
distance below us and to our right. The battery
was called out and we took up the line of
march to meet the enemy. We camped that
night near a church, when we were informed
that the enemy's demonstration was against a
small salt works, an enterprising citizen having
erected a small furnace with a half a dozen boilers,
in which he boiled sea water to obtain salt,
which, at that time, was selling at a dollar a
pound by the hundred pound sack. The Company
returned to camp.</p>

<p>About ten days later word came late one
afternoon that the enemy is making for Pocotalico,
a small station on the Savannah and
Charleston Railroad, intending to burn a long
range of trestle on said road. Two detachments
were sent to that place by post haste, arriving
in time to place themselves in position, in as
quiet a way as possible. At about ten o'clock
P. M. we heard a very noisy demonstration
to our right, through the marshes of the
swamps; many torches became visible. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
undoubtedly expected the place to be unprotected;
when they came within full range we
sent canister and schrapanel into the ranks;
they fell back in confusion, leaving dead and
wounded behind. This expedition started out
from Beauford, S. C., then in possession of the
enemy. One dark night the tide being up, the
Nashville loaded with cotton attempted to run
the gauntlet of the blockaders. On the turn of
the river just opposite the Fort, the River
Ogechee being about a mile wide, the vessel run
aground on a sand bank, and was unable to
extricate itself. The enemy being on the lookout,
spied her position and came within firing
distance; the Fort fired at them furiously, but
they paid no attention to us, but concentrated
their fire on the steamer Nashville with hot
shots and soon had her in flames. The crew
jumped overboard and swam ashore like ducks.
The steamer was burned and completely
destroyed. I was again taken with chills and
fever and sent home by way of Dr. Whitehead's
hospital. Sergeant Hines also came home to
recuperate, when one morning I suggested to
have an egg-nog. Cousin Abe was a merchant
before the war, and still kept a store at Fenns
Bridge, but the store had but few remnants in
it. He only kept such goods as people were willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
to dispose of in the way of exchange, for
something else, and among his stock, he had a
barrel of corn whiskey. I said, "Bill, if you
furnish the eggs, I will furnish the sugar and
whiskey; my chill will be on at eleven o'clock;
we have an hour yet and kill or cure, I'm going
to drink nog. It may help me." Dr. Whitehead
had supplied me with a vial of Fowler's
Solution, which was nearly exhausted, and which
had done me no good. Sergeant Hines came up,
brought a dozen eggs and we made a nog. At ten
thirty A. M. I took the first goblet, he made it
tolerably strong. I replenished and enjoyed the
contents, and as we were sipping it quietly, I
looked at my watch and was surprised to see it
was fifteen minutes past eleven and no chill. We
slowly finished the third glass, I felt the effects
of it somewhat, but we were not intoxicated.
At twelve o'clock the dinner bell rang at the
house, and it was the first time in two weeks
that I was able to partake of that meal, the
chills always interfering. I never had another
chill in twenty years thereafter, hence I never
became a prohibitionist. I believe the abuse of
whiskey is wrong, while its proper use is right.
Sergeant Hines and myself, after a few days
longer among our friends, returned to our
camp.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<p>The following incident caused a rupture of
friendship between Lieutenant Evan P. Howell
and myself, which made military service unnecessarily
harder on me, owing to our respective
ranks. One night, it was on a Saturday, I had
occasion to get up, it was late. I passed the
sentinel on post number one, and recognized
William Tolson on duty. I passed the usual
greeting of "Hello! Bill, how do you do," "O,
Ike, I'm so sick. I've one of the hardest chills
on me I ever had." "Why don't you call the
Corporal of the Guard, and get relief?" He
replied, he wished I would call him, so I called
"Corporal of the Guard, post number one."
Corporal William O'Quinn came up to see
what's up. I said, "Corporal, Tolson is sick
and ought to be relieved." Presently the Corporal
returned from headquarters, saying the
officers are all gone over to Patterson, they were
having a dance at the Quartermaster's, Major
Cranston, and there is no one at headquarters
but Dr. Stevenson who is drunk, and I can't get
any sense out of him. When I told him that one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of the men were sick, he said "You see that
puppy, is he not the finest you have ever seen?"
having reference to a small dog he fondled.
Finding out that I can't get any relief, I came
back, so I told Tolson to go in and I would
stand guard in his place. Tolson was a good
soldier, he was a native Englishman, and when
he got over his chill he was loud in his denunciation
as to his treatment, so he was punished
for having spoken derogatory about the officers
and condemned to wear ball and chain for twenty-four
hours. This was the first time that I
knew there was such a thing as a ball and chain
in camp for the punishment of man. The following
Monday night, the writer having found
out all about the particulars and the doings at
the Quartermaster's, wrote up a program of
intoxication at Granston Hall, Saturday night,
March 1863. I treated the matter more of a
burlesque than otherwise, and wound up in
these words: "That's the way Confederate
whiskey goes, pop goes the Government."
Captain Martin was off and Lieutenant Howell
was in command. Lieutenants Bland and Roberson
laughed over the matter and took it good
naturedly. W. N. Harmon was the only man
in the Company who saw me write the article,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
and when finished I read it to him. He pronounced
it a good joke and asked me what I was
going to do with it. I said, "I am going to
stick it up on the big pine where general orders
are posted, so that the men can read it after
reveille call," so he made some lightwood pegs,
and we went together and posted it. The article
was not signed, and was written in a round
handwriting. The men enjoyed it and laughed
a great deal over it, when Sergeant Fulford
came up and tore down the paper, and carried
it to the officer's tent. They inquired, what is
the matter, what are the men laughing about.
He presented the paper. Lieutenant Howell,
after reading it, got raving mad, while Lieutenants
Roberson and Bland took it good naturedly.
Lieutenant Howell was determined to
find out the author, so during the day he took up
the men by fours and swore them on the Bible,
if they knew who wrote the paper. I was at
the station on that day and was absent. When
I returned to my mess, they told me what was
going on, and that Lieutenant Howell was trying
to find out who wrote that article, so I said,
"Bill," meaning William Harmon, "He took
up the wrong men; if he had called on me I
would have saved him that trouble". He answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
"Well, what will you do?" "Well, you
don't believe that I would swear to a lie?" I got
up saying, "I will satisfy his curiosity," and up
to his tent I went. He was sitting in a chair
smoking. "Good evening Lieutenant," says I.
"I understand that you are very anxious to
know who wrote that paper Sergeant Fulford
submitted for your inspection. I can give you
all the information you require." Lieutenant
Howell at once brightened up and became all
smiles. "You know&mdash;who did it?" "Your
humble servant." In a twinkling his countenance
changed. He became pale with rage,
working himself into a passion, and very peremptorily
ordered me to stand at attention. I
at once planted my heels together to form a perfect
angle, placed my little fingers along the
seams of my pantaloons, my arms extending at
full length, my body erect, facing my superior
officer. I humbly remarked, "Will that do?"&mdash;"What
did you do it for?"&mdash;"You had your
fun, am I not entitled to have some?"&mdash;"You
made false charges; you said we drank Government
whiskey. I want you to understand what
liquor we drank we bought and paid for it."
"Well, Lieutenant, I have not accused anybody;
not even mentioned a single name, but if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the cap fits you, you can wear it. I have nothing
to retract." By that time, Howell was
surely mad. "I-I-I reduce you to ranks! I put
you on double duty for thirty days and to wear
ball and chain." "Is that all?" "Lieutenant,
I volunteered in the Confederate army to do my
full duty, as I always have done, in regard to
duty; you only can put me on every other day,
but when it comes to degrading me by making
me wear ball and chain, I give you fair notice
that I will kill any man who attempts to place
the same on my limbs," and I made my exit,
going to my mess-mates. "Well, how did you
come out?" the boys asked me. I related what
had passed between Lieutenant and I. William
Harmon, then said, "Did you tell him that I
helped you stick it up?" I said, "No, I shouldered
the whole responsibility. What good
would it do to implicate you?" "Well you
shall not be the only one to do double duty,"
and off he went to tell Lieutenant Howell that
he also had a hand in it, and consequently he
was also condemned to double duty for thirty
days. "Did he also tell you to wear ball and
chain?" Harmon said "No."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>That night, I slept, as the saying is, with one
eye open. I had my pistol within easy reach,
and my sabre by my side. No attempt however,
was made to chain me. The following morning
I was called for guard duty. I took my post,
carrying my sabre across my neck, bear fashion.
My post was in full view of the officers' headquarters.
When Lieutenant Howell sent Sergeant
Hines to me to tell me if I didn't carry my
sabre at "Carry Sabre," he would keep me on
four hours instead of two. Having been the
bugler of the Company I was never instructed
how to carry sabre. "Sergeant, can't you teach
me how?" Hines remarked, "I know you know
better how to handle a sabre than anyone in
camp. I have seen you and Hoffman fight at
Laurel Hill. I tell you, I have been on duty all
night and I would like to go to sleep. This may
be fun to you, but not to me, just now." I said,
"Well Bill, go ahead," so I carried my sword
to suit his Excellency, the commanding officer.</p>

<p>Later in the day J. J. Sheppard came to me
saying, "Ike, Lieutenant Howell told me that I
was appointed bugler in your place." "Well,
sir, I congratulate you on your promotion."
"He said for me to ask you for the bugle." I
said, "All right Sheppard," I took the bugle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
and broke it in halves and handed it to Sheppard.
He looked astonished&mdash;I remarked,
"That instrument is private property and
belongs to me, my money paid for it, and I have
a right to handle it as I please, not meaning any
disrespect to you, Sheppard." The following
day, word came in camp for volunteers to handle
siege pieces in Charleston, S. C. The enemy
making heavy demonstration against that City.
The Company sent men they could spare,
among whom I formed a contingent part. My
detachment was placed in the battery in charge
of a heavy siege gun. The people of that City
treated us royally and brought us plenty of provisions
besides what we got from the commissary.
We remained there a couple of weeks.
The whole business turned out to be a fiasco,
and we returned back to our camps. It was
one of the most pleasant periods I have enjoyed
during the whole war. I was again called on
duty when I remarked, "This comes around
pretty often." The Sergeant remarked, "You
have to finish your sentence." I at once went
to headquarters and met Lieutenant Howell and
said, "Do you intend to make me finish the penalty
you imposed on me?" "To be sure, I do,"
was his reply. "Well, you can't do it after you
accepted my services for Charleston," and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
demanded a court-martial before I would finish
it. Afterwards Sergeant Hines came from
headquarters, saying, "Howell said, Ike got
me," "I have no right to inflict a continuance of
punishment after accepting his services in some
other direction, but confound him, I'll get even
with him." Thus matters stood, when some
fine day the ball and chain was missing, no one
knew what became of it, but somewhere in the
middle of the Ogeechee River some two hundred
yards below Camp Arnold, it may be found now,
having rested there these forty six years.</p>

<p>On the eighth of May we were ordered to
Mississippi. We went by the way of Columbus,
Ga., arriving there about three o'clock P. M.
The ladies had prepared a fine spread for us
at the depot. The men were hungry. Capt. F.
G. Wilkins being mayor of the City, Mayor Wilkins
was Captain of the Columbus Guards, Company
B, First Regiment, Georgia Volunteers,
and on his return home, after his severe experience
of one year's military service, he preferred
civil service as more congenial to his
feelings. He was a brave and fearless soldier.
At Carricks Ford, he and twelve of his men got
mixed in with the Yankees, who at that time
wore also grey uniforms. They were Ohio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
troops. Captain Wilkins on seeing his dilemma,
formed his men into line, then into column making
them go through evolutions, and manual of
arms, and marched them to the rear, and out
of the Yankee columns without being suspicioned
or receiving a scratch. Such coolness is not
often exhibited on a danger line, and Captain
Wilkins reached Monterey long before any of
the Regiment did, and saved himself and his
men a great deal of hardship.</p>

<p>When alighting from the train and seeing all
those good things prepared for us, I at once took
my position. A lady remarked, "Help yourself."
I took hold of a piece of fowl, and as I
was about to take a bite, someone struck me on
the arm with such force that the piece of fowl
dropped out of my hand, and someone said,
"Those things are not for you." It was Mayor
Wilkins. He was glad to see me, and said, "I
have something better for you, boys. How
many of the First Georgia are here? Get them
all together and follow me." We were about a
dozen of the old Washington Rifles. He conducted
us to a room where we met a committee
of gentlemen. After the usual shaking hands
and introductions, we passed into another chamber.
I never beheld a more bountiful and artistically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
prepared spread. Provisions arranged
on a revolving table, shelved to a pyramid,
and loaded with delicious wines. In a corner of
the room was a table covered with case liquors
of every description, and some fine cigars. I
was astonished, I had no idea such delicacies
could have been gotten in the whole Confederacy.
We surely did enjoy the hospitality of
that Committee. Mayor Wilkins introduced
me to a Mr. Rothschild, saying, "I want you to
take good care of him, he is a splendid fellow."
Turning to me he said, "Hermann, I want you
to stay all night with this gentleman, he
will treat you all right." I said, "Captain Wilkins,
I can't leave camps without a permit, and
myself and Captain Howell are not on such
terms as for me to ask him for any favors."
"Well, I'll arrange that, you come along."
Captain Wilkins said to Howell, "I want Ike
to go home with my friend here," designating
Mr. Rothschild. Captain Howell said, "You'll
have to be here by seven o'clock, A. M. The
train will leave at that time." Mr. Rothschild
spoke up, saying, "I'll have him here on time."
I was royally treated; the lady of the house and
daughter played on the piano and sang. I
joined in the chorus 'till late in the night, when
I was shown to my room, nicely furnished, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
nice clean feather bed and all the requisites for
comfort, but I could not sleep, I did not lay comfortable.
The two years service I had seen,
made a feather bed rather an impediment to my
repose, having become accustomed to sleep out
doors on the hard ground, with my knapsack
as a pillow, so I got up, put my knapsack under
my head and lay by the side of the bed on the
carpet, and slept like a log the balance of the
night; so soundly, that I did not hear the negro
boy who was sent to my room to blacken my
boots, open the door, but I heard a noise like
someone slamming the door and I heard someone
running down stairs. I heard many voices
talking, and someone coming up stairs, opening
the door very unceremoniously, I looked&mdash;there
was Mr. Rothschild,&mdash;greatly astonished and
laughing, he could hardly talk. Finally he said,
"What in the world made you lay on the floor."
I explained to him that being no longer used
to sleeping on a bed, I could not rest until I got
on the hard floor. Then he told me he had sent
up a boy to blacken my boots, who had scared
them all by telling them that the man up stairs
had fallen off of the bed and lay dead on the
floor. I took my ablution, and went down to
breakfast, all enjoying that I was still able to
do justice to the meal that my kind host and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
hostess set before me. After many thanks and
good byes to Mr. and Mrs. Rothschild and the
family, Mr. Rothschild and myself went down
to the train, which was in waiting. Everything
was soon ready and we departed for Mobile,
Ala. At Greenville, Ala., I met General W. H.
T. Walker for the first time. Martin's battery
was assigned to his brigade. Captain Martin
was promoted to Major, and Chief of Staff of
General Walker's brigade, and Lieutenant Evan
P. Howell, by right of seniority, took his place
as Captain. From Mobile, we went to Jackson,
Miss., one section of two cannons were left
behind under charge of Lieutenant Robson. The
balance arrived at destination at about three
o'clock P. M., May 12th, 1863. We unloaded the
pieces at once, and all the accoutrements, all
the horses and harnessed them up without the
loss of any time, took up the line of march
towards Raymond Springs. The weather was
very warm and the road of red clay was very
dusty for men marching in columns. The dust
would rise like clouds of ashes at every step.
It must be remembered that it was ration day,
but we had no time to draw any. As we
advanced, we met General Gists' Brigade just
out of a fight with General Grant's forces, who
landed at Port Gibson, on his forward move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
to Vicksburg. General Gist had several prisoners.
Among them was a Captain. I spoke
to him and asked him about the strength
of Grant's army. Of course, I did not expect
a truthful answer. He replied, "If
you'll keep on in the direction you are going,
you will meet him. He is not so very
far, ahead of you, and when you do meet him,
you will think he has more than enough to eat
you all up." Well, he did tell the truth, and it
has been our misfortune all through the war to
fight against many odds. We kept advancing,
when of a sudden the command was ordered to
halt. We formed ourselves into battery, and I
was placed in charge of a detachment. General
Walker ordered me to follow him. About two
hundred yards ahead the road took a sudden
turn around the bluff, which commanded a
straight stretch of about a mile. General Walker
ordered me to unlimber my gun and place
it in position, so as to command that road, and
ordered me to fire into any cavalry that might
appear. At the further end of my view was a
water mill. I remarked, "General, had I not
better let them advance somewhat, so as not to
waste too much ammunition?" "You must use
your own judgment," said he. Looking about
me, I saw no infantry in close proximity, so I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
ventured to ask him where my support was.
He answered, "Support Hell!&mdash;If they charge
you, fight them with the hand spikes, don't you
never leave this post," and left.</p>

<p>Mr. James F. Brooks acted as my No. 1. I
asked him if he had made his will, if not, he had
better, as we were there to stay. We watched
with all our eyes, we saw no enemies. Just
about dark, we were ordered to limber up, and
double quick to the rear, for about a mile, the
enemy having taken another route and we were
in danger of being cut off. Weary and footsore,
having marched about ten miles that afternoon,
we retraced our steps within about three
miles of Jackson, hungry and thirsty, we
marched on, large oaks bordered the road at
places and the roots protruded above the surface
of the ground; having on a pair of shoes,
left foot number six for a number 8 foot, while
my right shoe was a number 10 brogan, I crammed
cotton in shoe number 10 to prevent too
much friction and cut off the end of number 6
to avoid the painful sensation of being cramped,
but misfortunes never come single&mdash;the night
became dark and it threatened to rain. I stumbled
over one of those protruding roots and
tore off half of my unprotected toe nail on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
left foot, a most excruciating and painful sensation.
I did not swear, because I was speechless.
I mounted the caisson, our horses were
jaded, had had no food nor water that day, but
managed to get into camp. Dr. Stewart, our
surgeon was left at Jackson, with a few of our
command who were sick. W. J. Bell was our
ambulance driver. He drove me to Dr. Stewart's
camp to dress my wound that night. I was
all O. K. next morning, when the ball opened
after day break. Our pickets announced the
enemy's advance. The skirmishes then came
into play and kept the advance at some bay for
some time, our forces placing themselves in position
to receive them in due form. We were
five thousand strong, while the enemy numbered
twenty-five thousand. At about eleven A. M.
orders came from our right to left to fall back,
and we gradually withdrew, putting on our prolongs,
and firing occasionally as we retraced our
steps. When the fight first opened I was in the
rear, as stated, on account of my foot, but after
being dressed and hearing the firing, I made for
the front, and reported to Captain Howell for
duty, while he was in line of battle on the
extreme left. He said his detachment was complete,
to report to the next. Having only four
pieces of artillery in action, two under charge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of Lieutenant Robson not having yet arrived,
they were placed along the front about two hundred
yards apart, all had full working force. I
retraced my steps and so reported to the Captain,
saying, "Well, Captain, there being no use
for me here, I shall go to the rear to protect
myself and watch the progress of the fight,
should there be any casualties in the Company
I'll take their place&mdash;no use for me to be here
unless I can be of some service." Up to that
time the skirmish line was still contending for
every inch of the ground. Captain Howell says
to me, "You stay here, and act as my orderly.
I'm hoarse anyhow, and you have a good voice
and can repeat my orders and commands," so I
was installed by the side of the Captain. The
ground on which we stood was a gradual incline,
while that of the enemy was about on a level
with us, leaving a sort of a basin or valley
between both lines. It was a novel sight to see
our skirmishers contending every inch of the
ground before an overwhelming force, to see
them load and fire, and gradually falling back,
facing the advancing foe. When suddenly they
emerged from the woods, where they were concealed,
and advanced in platoon form, sending
their deadly missiles into our thin skirmishers
ranks. I said, "This is more than our men can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
stand, let me throw a shell over their heads,
into their ranks." He answered, "Do so, but
don't shoot our men." "No danger," said I.
I depressed the bridge of my piece, raising the
muzzle about four fingers. No. four pulled the
laniard. It had a good effect, and resulted in
stopping their advance, and thus enabled our
skirmishers to come in. My fire also gave them
our position and distance. They at once formed
a battery in front of us. I aimed a second shot
at a white horse. Captain Howell watching its
effect. I being behind the gun, the smoke prevented
me from so doing, when he said, "You
got him." I soon found out that I had done
some damage and that my range was accurate,
for they centered their fire of several pieces
against my own. One of their shots passed over
my gun and knocked off its sight, passed
between the detachment, striking the caisson lid
in the rear and staving it in, and thus preventing
us for a few minutes in replying. We had
to break it open with the hand spikes to get
ammunition. They undoubtedly thought that
we were irreparably silenced, and paid their
respects to some other part of our line, but we
resumed business again, and they came back at
us. I saw a ball rolling on the ground, about
six feet to my right. It seemed to be about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
same caliber as ours. It rolled up a stump,
bouncing about fifteen feet in the air. I thought
it was a solid shot and wanting to send it back
to them through the muzzle of our gun, I ran
after it. It proved to be a shell, as it exploded,
and a piece of it struck my arm. It was a painful
wound, but not serious. Another ball struck
a tree about eight inches in diameter, knocked
out a chip, which struck my face and caused
me to see the seven stars in plain day light and
very near got a scalp of Captain Howell, who
stood behind that tree. Orders came for Captain
Howell to fall back. He asked me to inform
Major Martin, who was in command of the piece
at the extreme right, that he was falling back.
I had to traverse the whole front of our line. I
took the color bearers' horse, a fine animal.
We named him Stonewall. The enemy's fire
was rather high, as they came up the incline
and the balls rattled through the tree tops like
hail. It commenced raining very hard. I dismounted
and took it afoot. On my way passing
the third section, Sim Bland, who acted as number
6, and whose duty it was to carry the ammunition
from the caisson and to hand it to No. 2
who inserts it in the muzzle of the gun, while
No. 1 rammed it home. As I crossed him at a
trot, I remarked, "Sim, this is hot time."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
Before he could reply, a solid cannon ball had
struck him. Poor fellow, he did not know what
hit him, for he was dead. His whole left side
entirely torn to pieces.</p>

<p>The enemy was now advancing more rapidly,
as our whole line had given away. On my return
I found my horse also shot down. I was trying
to save the body of Bland, but couldn't get the
assistance needed. I went through his pockets
and took what he had therein and gave it to his
brother, Lieutenant Bland. The enemy pushed
me so close I had to take to the woods in my
immediate rear, the trees of which somewhat
protected me from the enemy's fire. About a
hundred yards further I found Sergeant Newsome
with his gun and a detachment, trying to
make for the public road leading to Jackson.
He had managed so far to drive his command
evading the trees of the forest, when suddenly
he was confronted by a plank fence which stood
perfectly erect, not a plank missing and about
five feet high. He ordered the horses cut out
of the harness, and was about to abandon his
guns, when I hollered, "No Sergeant, don't do
it! Ride through between the posts, they are
wide enough apart, knock down the planks." I
put myself in action and kicked against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
planks, when the whole panel fell over, carrying
several others with it, for all the posts were
completely rotten at the ground, and thus I
saved this piece of artillery and probably the
men. We reached the road and marched in column.
It was raining hard and every man was
soaked to the skin. The column halted, having
fallen back about a half a mile, firing as they
went, when again we formed in line of battle.
I was very tired, and sat down by the road side.
When called again into action, I found that I
could not use my arm, and that the leaders of
my leg had contracted at my groins. The
enemy had again outflanked us, and the men
lifted me on a caisson.</p>

<p>The horses stalled. The road being very
muddy, the men had to assist at the wheel to
pull the carriages out of the mud, by using all
their efforts, so I had to get down, for I felt
that after all the gun would have to be abandoned,
and I did not care to be taken prisoner,
but General Joseph E. Johnston made a stand a
little further on, until the Yankees outflanked
him again. Major Martin happened to be just
passing me on his horse. I begged him to take
me behind him, as I could not walk. He answered,
"It is impossible, we are going to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
another stand. Get in the ambulance." When
the ambulance came in sight, it was full to overflow
with wounded and dying. The Major again
rode up. I said "Major Martin, can't you get
me out of my difficulty," he replied, "Hermann,
do the best you can to take care of yourself. If
they capture you, I will have you exchanged as
soon as possible." Poor consolation, I thought,
but I was determined not to be taken if I possibly
could help it, so I started towards Jackson,
taking the edge of the woods, first on account of
the mud, then as somewhat of a protection from
the bullets. My locomotion was slow, from eight
to ten inches was the longest strides I was able
to make, and this with excruciating pains. Presently
our forces rushed past me and formed
again into line of battle, thus leaving me between
both lines, the bullets coming from either
direction, when again I entered our line. This
maneuvre happened three times before I reached
Jackson, in a stretch of three miles. It was
then four o'clock p. m.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<p>When we reached Jackson the previous
day I noted a flat by the side of the railroad
bridge. I was thinking to cross Pearl River
by that means, so I started to the right towards
the railroad bridge. On my way down the
street a lady was standing over a tub of whiskey
with a dipper in her hand. She said to me,
"Poor fellow, are you wounded?" I said, "Yes."
She dipped up a dipper full of whiskey, which
I drank. It had a good effect on my shattered
nerves and did not cause me the least dizziness.
It was the medicine I surely needed. On arriving
at the River, I found the flat was gone, the
railroad bridge was the only chance left me to
cross. I crawled up the embankment and found
that the cross ties were too far apart for me to
step it, owing to my contracted leaders, so I
concluded to "coon it" on my hands and knees
on the stringers, holding onto the rail.</p>

<p>The bridge is a long one and very high, Jackson
being built on a high bluff. When about
half way across I heard a great deal of noise
and reports of fire arms; I heard bullets whizzing
by. Finally bullets were hitting the trestle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
beneath me and in front of me. Looking back
I saw at a distance of about four hundred yards
a force of the enemy, which I judged to be about
half a regiment, coming up the lowlands in a
flank around Jackson. My first impulse was,
can I make it across, or must I surrender? I
concluded to take the chances, and continued
to cross. Bullets were striking beneath me,
and in front, splinters were flying. One ball hit
the rail about six inches in front of my hand.
They were gaining on me fast, when at last I
reached the other side, laying myself flat on the
track, I rolled over, down about an eighteen
foot embankment. Thus being protected from
the enemy's bullets, I entered the swamp not
far beside the road leading to Branton, I noted
a large hollow poplar tree. It must have been
four or five feet in diameter. I crawled in, I
felt faint and weak, had not eaten anything that
day. I must have fainted; when presently I
heard the sound of artillery and musketry to
my right across the river and the noise of an
empty wagon coming from towards Branton. I
took a reconnoitering look, and saw Jackson on
fire and a wagon driven by a negro, holding the
lines over four splendid mules, coming towards
the city. I took my stand in the road, pistol in
hand. The following conversation ensued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>"Halt. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"To Jackson. Marse Richard sent me to
fotch his things. He is afraid the Yankees
would cotch him."</p>

<p>"How will you get across?"</p>

<p>"Goes on the flat, sah."</p>

<p>"There is no flat now."</p>

<p>"Yes there is, and Marse Richard&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Turn the head of the mules towards Branton,
or you are a dead Negro"&mdash;aiming at him
as I spoke. He exclaimed, "Don't shoot Marster,
I'll do as you say." He turned the mules
towards where he came from. I crawled behind
in the wagon, pistol in hand, and at a gallop all
the way for twelve miles. We entered Branton
in the early part of the night. The people were
still up at the Hotel. The excitement ran high
about the enemies capturing Jackson. Branton
was a nice little village. The negro proved to
be a run-away. Had stolen the team from the
quartermaster and running with it to the
enemy. The lady of the hotel came to me saying,
"Are you wounded?" I stated my condition,
and she sympathized with me, saying,
"Poor fellow, I expect you need something to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
eat." I surely did, for I was more dead than
alive, after having passed such an eventful day.
I ate a hearty supper. I was given a shirt. She
bandaged my arm, which was smarting badly.
She furnished me a room and a bottle of mustang
linament to rub myself. My clothes which
were full of mud were washed and dried by a
large fire. The following morning, I felt really
refreshed. It is unnecessary to say that I slept
well that night. At an early hour that morning,
the alarm of "The Yankees are coming. They
are only four miles from here and Johnston is
retreating towards Canton." Everybody that
could get away, left. The quartermaster had
an old broken down horse, which he tendered me
for having saved his fine team, and I left the
town on horse back, thanking my hostess for all
her kindness. About two miles from Branton I
met up with three men from my Company, viz,
A. P. Heath, Jackson O'Quinn and Harmon
Fields. They were not in the fight, having been
on the sick list and not fit for duty, so we traveled
together for some distance. We reached a
settlement, which from appearance, belonged to
well-to-do people. The gentleman of the premises
was standing at the gate leading to the
house. I said to my comrades that I would have
to rest and recuperate until I got well, so I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
addressed myself to the proprietor, "Sir, can
you take care of a wounded Confederate?" He
put his hand in his hip pocket in quick motion,
as if to draw a pistol, but instead drew a small
slate and pencil, handed it to me with a motion
to write my request, which I did. He rubbed it
out and wrote swiftly in a scholarly style,
"Nothing I have is too good for a Confederate
soldier. Walk in&mdash;all of you." His name was
Williams, unfortunately deaf and dumb, but
very intelligent. His family consisted of a wife
and two daughters, and all seemed to be well
educated and comfortably situated. They were
very solicitous in their attentions to us. The
girls played on the piano while I entertained the
old man, by writing on his slate my experience
of the previous day. He looked at me in wonder,
and occasionally took hold of my hand and
shook it. I remained his guest for nearly a
week, until we located our Company, and where
to meet it. I got entirely well, my arm was
healing nicely, under the care of Mrs. Williams.
Our forces had located at Canton. He sent us
mule-back through Pearl River Swamp to the
Canton road, while I rode my horse. He refused
to take any remuneration for anything he
had done for us, so I sent back my horse with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
note and begged him to accept the same and
thanking them all for what they had done
for us.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<p>The following day I entered camp with my
comrades among great cheers, all having
thought me dead or a prisoner. Major Martin
asked me how I got through. I told him I took
his advice and did the best I could. I related
to him the incidents that I met with.
He said, "Well, I congratulate you. I don't
believe one in a thousand would have escaped."
"I was glad I was the one." We were ordered
to strike tents at Canton, and we retraced our
steps again towards Jackson, a distance of between
twenty and twenty-five miles. It was one
of the hottest days of the season. The road bed
being red clay. Our forces now amounted to
about eight thousand men, and marching in
column with artillery, wagon train and all the
paraphernalia appertaining to a moving army,
raised such intense dust that it was impossible
to recognize one's file-leader in his immediate
front. Every step of every individual raised
clouds of dust, which lay ankle deep. It was
actually suffocating. Men and horses would
gasp for breath. The men occasionally would
expectorate large lumps of clay that settled in
their throats, and no water to be had. We didn't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
pass a single stream of any kind. It was a forced
march to get in the enemy's rear and to cut off
reinforcement and supplies for Grant's invading
forces onto Vicksburg. The enemy was also
making back to Jackson on the Clinton Road
which ran nearly parallel to the Canton Road,
and we could see their advance by the column of
dust to our right. Just before dark a very
heavy rain and thunder storm set in. It was
preferable to the previous conditions of the
weather, although it put us half leg deep in
sticky red mud. It got so dark we could not
see anything and the rain continued pouring
down in all its fury. It was nip and tuck as to
which army would reach Jackson first. We got
there just a little ahead of the enemy in time to
occupy the ditches which now were nearly knee
deep in water. In that condition we passed the
night, expecting to be attacked momentarily.
Men were detailed long in the rear to cook
rations for the men in the ditch, which were
issued along the line, and consisted of corn
bread cooked (a la hate) and a piece of fat
bacon. A very amusing incident happened to
one of my comrades, W. A. Grimes, who early
on our march, and before the dust got so dense,
had to step aside for some reason, and being
detained while the column kept onward, threw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
him some distance behind his command. The
State of Georgia had sent her troops some
shoes; the description of my draw I have
already stated, and some white wool hats.
Grimes put his name on the front of his hat
in large capital letters, and as he hurried to
catch up with his command, someone hollowed
as he passed, "How are you Bill Grimes?"
Grimes stopped in surprise to see who knew him
in some other command. Others took up the
word all along the line of "How are you Bill
Grimes?" Grimes hurried on, on his way, the
perspiration running down his face, which had
the appearance of being covered with a mask.
He could not account for his sudden popularity
until he pulled off his hat to wipe off his face.
He saw his name on his hat and quickly turned
it wrong side out. His name had passed all
along the column faster than he could travel
and passed Howell's Battery long before he
caught up with it. Early in the morning the
enemy made demonstrations all along our line
and was repulsed. It had quit raining. The
artillery kept up a desultory fire for eight days
and nights. The enemy's forces were at least
three to our one and therefore, could relieve
each other, while we were obliged to be kept
continually on duty, and consequently became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
exhausted, my eyes were blood shot, men
loaded and fired mechanically, and when so
exhausted that I couldn't stand any longer, I
dropped beside one of the pieces and in a jiffy,
was asleep. I couldn't even hear the report of
the guns within a few feet of me. The strain
was more than my physique could stand. I got
sick and unconscious, and when I came to
myself, I was in Yazoo City in a private house,
snugly fixed, and a kindly lady by my bedside,
whose name was Mrs. Lyons. She cried for
joy to see me recover my senses. I asked her
where I was and how long I had been there. She
said just a week. I asked her what place it was
and she said "Yazoo City." I shall always
remember gratefully the kind treatment I
received from that worthy family, and when
after a week's convalescence, I took my leave
with many thanks. The lady said she hoped
that her brother who was in the Virginia army
would in case of sickness receive the attention
that she would bestow on any Confederate soldier.
Such was the spirit that prevailed
throughout the Confederate States.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>


<p>I rejoined my command at Morton station
on the M. &amp; O. Railroad. The object of the
second fight at Jackson, as I understood it, was
to get in the rear of the investing army of
Vicksburg under General Grant. General
Joseph E. Johnston expected a reinforcement,
sufficient so as to cut off supplies from the
invading army, and to attack it in the rear,
while General Pemberton might make a sortie
and attack it in the front, and thus save Vicksburg
from capture. Our reinforcement never
came. We then moved to Vaughn Station and
thus hung in the rear of Grant, but not strong
enough to venture an attack, unless in concert
with General Pemberton who was defeated at
Big Black and bottled up in Vicksburg, his
stronghold. A very sad incident happened in
our camp. Lieutenant Ruben Bland, a very
kind officer and beloved by all his men, died. His
brother Sim, as stated, was killed at the first
fight at Jackson. They were very much
attached to each other and brooding over his
misfortune, some thought he took opium with
suicidal intent, others thought otherwise. The
writer was sitting on a box on the railroad platform,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
smoking his pipe. Close to the platform
stood the Company's ambulance. In passing me
Lieutenant Bland remarked, "Well, Ike, you
seem to enjoy your pipe," I answered, "I do,
I smoke the pipe of peace," he smiled and said,
"Yes, everything looks peaceable here, I
believe I am going to take a nap in this ambulance."
About a quarter of an hour after, Quinten
Dudley who was Hospital Steward, had
cause to get some medicine out of the medicine
chest that Dr. Stewart kept in the ambulance.
He immediately gave the alarm that Lieutenant
Bland was dead. I could not believe it. I
jumped off the platform into the ambulance,
and there lay Lieutenant Bland stretched out
in full length, his face purple. Dr. Stewart,
who at once was on hand opened an artery on
top of his head. He bled freely. He tried to
get up artificial respiration by working his arm
back and forth, but to no avail. Bland was
dead beyond recovery and mourned by every
member of the Company.</p>

<p>It was on a very warm June day when I concluded
to have a general cleaning up. It must
be remembered that we lost all of our personal
effects, which we destroyed to keep them from
falling into the enemy's hands, and our wardrobes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
only consisted of what we carried on our
backs and filth begot what we called "creepers",
and one not used to such made him feel most
miserable, so I took a camp kettle which also
served for our culinary purposes to boil my
clothes in, and while they were drying in the
sun, I crept into the bushes in the shade and fell
asleep. During my repose some miscreant stole
my shirt, and for several weeks I did not have a
shirt on my back, so one day it came to my
knowledge that Gen. W. H. T. Walker, our Division
Commander, having been promoted, and
Colonel Claude Wilson, was appointed as Brigadier
General in his place, offered a reward of
thirty days furlough and a fine saddle horse to
ride during the war to any man that would
carry a dispatch to General Pemberton who
was then besieged in Vicksburg. I told Sergeant
Hines if any man needed a furlough I did,
in the fix I was in. I believe I will go and offer
my services. He laughed and said, "Well, good
luck old fellow." So I started to headquarters
which were in an abandoned farm house, about
a quarter of a mile distant from where our battery
was in camp. I walked to the sentinel who
halted me. I want to see Gen. Walker. "You
can't get in." "Call the officer of the guard,"
says I, which he did and the Lieutenant came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
up. I stated to him that I wanted to see Gen.
Walker. "Follow me," says he, which I did.
There were at least from twenty to twenty-five
officers of all grades sitting in a large room,
engaged, it seemed to me, in social conversation.
I walked straight up to General Walker
and stated my business, and what I had heard
he offered to any man who would successfully
carry a dispatch to General Pemperton at
Vicksburg. "I thought, if any man needed a
furlough, it was I." Opening my jacket which
was closely buttoned, although it was a hot day
in July, I displayed my nakedness. "I have
not even, as you see, a shirt to wear." It
raised a giggle among some of the officers, while
others looked upon me in sympathy. I stated
how I lost that only shirt I possessed. Just at
that time entered Major Martin. Recognizing
me, he said, "Hermann, you here?" He
seemed rather surprised. I stated the object of
my visit. He turned to General Walker, saying,
"General, I stand sponsor for this man. He
belongs to my battery, and he is one of the best."
I inclined my head in recognition of the compliment
paid me, and he extended me his hand.
In the meantime, General Walker called me and
said, "You see that small trunk in yonder corner.
Therein is my wardrobe. I believe I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
three shirts therein; that is all I have&mdash;I divide&mdash;go
and get you one. We are about the same
size. I hope it will fit you." I made for the
little hairy trunk, no bigger than a good hand
valise and slightly oval, opened the lid, saying,
"Beggars ought not to be choosers. I will take
the first I come to," which was a clean white
shirt, with cuffs and collars attached. Off went
my jacket in the presence of the company; into
the garment I went, feeling a thousand per cent.
better. I said, "Well, General, I've heard of
some stepping into other men's shoes, but never
before have I known of a high private slipping
into a General's shirt at one jump." This
brought a big laugh from the assembly, the
General joining heartily. I thanked him and
extended my hand in token of my appreciation.
He remarked, "You are surely
welcome, come around tomorrow at eleven
o'clock A. M., and we will talk matters
over." He asked, "Have you ever been to
Vicksburg." "No Sir." "Do you know anything
about the country around, and about the
City?" "This is my first experience in these
diggins." "How would you manage?" "I'll
be governed by circumstances as they present
themselves." After a pause he repeated,
"Come around tomorrow at eleven o'clock." I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
gave the military salute and started towards the
door, when he called me saying, "Do you ever
drink anything?" I answered, "General, this is
a strange question. Why didn't Jack eat his
supper? I've not seen a drop since we left Jackson,"
and I stated how I got that. He laughed
and said, "Go in that room," indicating the door
with his index finger. "You will find a table in
there with liquors, I think a good drink will do
you good." One invitation was sufficient. I
stepped into the next room, and there I beheld
a round table loaded with all kinds of bottles,
containing different liquors, some labeled different
kinds of whiskies, brandies, gin, schedam,
schnapps, etc. I took the square bottle of schedam
and poured me out a stiff drink, thanked
the General and departed for my camp, but not
being in the habit of drinking, I felt the effects
of the liquor. I felt somewhat, what I may call
buoyant, and in for any fun. I met Sergeant
W. H. Hines. He said, "Ike, what luck?" "The
best in the world," tapping myself on the breast.
"You see that shirt, this once was General Walker's,
now it's mine." I told him all that passed
at headquarters. The next day I reported as
directed. The General said, "Well, Hermann,
the jig is up. While we were talking about the
matter yesterday, Pemberton surrendered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
I therefore do not need your services." I said,
"well, I wish he had held out until some other day
than the fourth of July." The General said,
"Yes."</p>

<p>As I started to camp, the General said, "Well,
Hermann I thank you anyhow for your offer
and you shall have a furlough all the same. I
give you two weeks. I hope you will have a nice
time." Major Martin who was present said
also, he hoped I would have a nice time. I
replied, "Major, I have not a cent of money,
how can I have a nice time. We have not been
paid off since we left Savannah. Have you some
money? If so I would like to borrow until I get
mine from the Government." He said, he had
a fifty dollar bill. If it would do me any good, I
could have it. He handed me the bill which was
then worth about two or three dollars in specie.
Such was the depreciation of our currency. I
went into the interior about ten miles from
camp. The people were downcast. They did
not know what would become of them. Jackson,
the capital of the State, in the hands of the
enemy. Vicksburg, a large and well fortified
city and defended by a large army had surrendered
and its defenders taken prisoners. The
people were in despair, not knowing what evil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
awaited them. I soon found out that camps
among the boys was the more congenial place
for me, so after an absence of three days I
returned.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<p>So one good afternoon, J. B. Thomas, a good
clever comrade and good soldier, and myself
took a stroll and incidentally looking for something
to eat. We passed a vegetable garden,
a luxury we seldom enjoyed. On the side of the
pailings were some squashes. Thomas remarked,
I wish I had some of them. I said, "Well,
slip one of those palings and get a few, I'll be on
the watch out." No sooner said than done.
Thomas gathered about a dozen the size of my
fist. He stuck them in his shirt bosom. I gave
him the alarm that the lady was watching him.
As he looked up he saw her at the other end of
the garden. He started through the opening he
had made quicker than a rabbit could have done
when pursued by hounds. Thomas is a man of
small stature and very short legged, but he
split the air to beat the band. We were both
in our shirt sleeves, no vests, only wore pants
confined around the waist by a belt, the squashes
were bobbing up and down in his shirt, as he
progressed and the proprietress after him.
Finally the squashes lifted the shirt out of his
confines and down came the squashes rolling
on the ground. Thomas did not stop, but casting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
a regretful side glance at his booty, he sped
on to camp, while his garment was floating to
the breeze, caused by his velocity. When the
woman reached the spot where the squashes lay
scattered, she stopped, looking after the fleeing
individual and sending a full vocabulary of
invectives after him. I who had followed leisurely
caught up while she gathered her squashes
into her apron. I remarked, "Madam, you seem
to have spilled your vegetables." "No, it was
not me that spilled them, it's that good for
nothing somebody, there he runs&mdash;he stole them
out of my garden." I said, "He ought not to
have done it, if I knew who he was I would
report him." She said, "I would not have
minded to give him some if he had asked me
for them, but I don't like for anybody to go into
my garden and take what belongs to me." Poor
woman, she had no idea that within a few days
after our departure, the enemy would appear
and not only appropriate the needful, but
would destroy all the rest to keep her from enjoying
any of it. She offered me some of the
squashes which I accepted with thanks. I carried
them to Thomas, saying she would have
given you some if you had asked for them.
Thomas replied, he wished he had known it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<p>The fall of Vicksburg ended the Mississippi
Campaign, and our troops were ordered to join
the Army of Tennessee. All had left with the
exception of the Mississippi Regiment and our
battery who were awaiting transportation. Our
commissary had also gone ahead of us and so
we were left to "root hog or die." We had to
eat once in awhile any how. Quinton Dudley
and myself took a stroll to the commissary of
the Mississippi Regiment. I learned that his
name was Coleman. Passing through the building
which was an old wooden railroad warehouse
about a hundred feet long and forty wide,
Quinton picked up a piece of rock salt from a
large pile. Captain Coleman saw him put something
in his haversack. In a brisk manner, said,
"What is that you have taken?" He showed
him a piece of salt the size of a hen egg. "Put
it back," he hollowed at him. Quinton threw
it back on the pile very much humiliated. On
our leaving the building, I spied on the platform
at the other end of the warehouse a large hogshead
full of smoked meat of all descriptions,
there were sides, shoulders and hams. They
looked very enticing for hungry men like we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
were. We went to camp and reported how that
Captain had caught Quinton who was very timid
and did not like to be caught in the act. Others
felt different about such. We were entitled to
a living while in the field on duty. Some suggested
that we go and charge the commissary
and get some rations. I said, "That would
bring on some trouble. Maybe we might get
some of that meat by strategy," so we planned
that W. N. Harmon should take ten men around
and about the warehouse, while I would engage
the Captain in conversation, during which time
Harmon and his men would help themselves to
rations. I awaited an opportune moment when
Captain Coleman was at the other end of the
building from where the hogshead of meat stood.
Entering by that end, I walked squarely up to
the Captain, extending my hand. "How do
you do, Captain Coleman? I'm very glad to
meet you, it is an unexpected pleasure. How
long since you have heard from home?" He
looked at me in surprise, holding onto my hand.
I heard some meat drop on the ground. I knew
the meat was flying campwards. "Well," said
Capt. Coleman, "you have the advantage of me."
"Don't you know me?" says I? He replied,
"Well, your face is familiar to me, but I can't
place you. Are you not from Emanuel county,
Georgia?" "No, but I have some kinfolks in
Georgia with my name." "Well, then I am
mistaken and beg your pardon." "We have a
lake on the Ogeechee River called Coleman's
Lake. I went there often for fishing, and was
sure you were one of the Colemans that lived
there when at home. You favor them very
much." "Well, said he, they may be some kin
to me." By that time, between thirty and forty
pieces of meat had changed hands. The next
morning transportation came, and we loaded
the cars which carried us to the Tennessee
Army, then under the command of General
Bragg, who was then retreating, leaving Tennessee
to the tender care of the Federals, under
command of General Rosencrantz. Our forces
took a stand around and about Lookout Mountain
and Chickamauga. We struck camp some
distance from the main forces after unloading
the train and watering and feeding the horses.
The boys took a swim in the river, a luxury not
realized for many days past. I was detailed to
cut underbrush in the woods to assist stretching
ropes to corral our horses. I was not quite
as green in handling an axe by this time as I
was in Virginia, when I was detailed to cut wood
for the blacksmith shop. I was again taken sick
with risings in my ear. I suffered as only those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a><br /><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
who ever suffered with such affliction knew
how to extend their sympathy. The pains were
simply excruciating and threw me into hot fever.
We were ordered to strike camps. We marched
that forenoon until eleven o'clock. The sun
was shining in full force. I could no longer
keep up. I stopped by the roadside and lay
down, waiting for the Company's baggage
wagon to come along. Lorenzo Stephens was
the driver. After awhile he appeared on foot.
One of the rear axles of his wagon having broken,
he therefore hurried forward to get some
assistance. In the meantime, the ambulance
came along in charge of the Company surgeon.
He had me picked up and placed in it. He said
I had high fever and gave me some medicine,
and as we passed the station of a railroad, the
name of which I did not know, I was put on the
train with others and sent to the Atlanta Hospital,
in charge of Dr. Paul Eve, of Augusta,
Dr. Rosser being in charge of my ward. I was
suffering terribly, both of my ears were discharging
corruption. Through suffering and
hardship, my general health was giving away.
I needed rest and time to recuperate. Medicines
were hard to get, and I was slow in recovering
my strength. One day Dr. Rosser asked
me if I would like to have a furlough. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
thought it would help me. I said, "Yes, the best
in the world, as soon as I can gain a little
strength," so he and Dr. Eve came to my cot the
following morning, and after examining my
condition, departed. Dr. Rosser came again in
the afternoon and handed me a thirty days furlough.
I was very grateful to him. He was a
perfect gentleman, hard working and sympathetic.
I came home to my foster mother, Mrs.
Jas. L. Braswell, under whose care I soon
gained strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<p>Before leaving the hospital I requested
Dr. Rosser to inform my Captain of my
whereabouts and of my physical condition,
which he promised he would do, and I have no
doubts he did. While at home I also corresponded
with some of my comrades. I enjoyed
my furlough at Fenns Bridge among my friends.
Colonel Sol. Newsome, Hudson W. Sheppard,
Bennett Hall, W. J. Lyons, Daniel Inman and
others, who came after their mail and incidentally
brought their fishing tackle and guns to
fish and hunt in the Ogeechee river and swamp,
in the meantime discussing the ups and downs
of the men in the field. The above named citizens
were all slave owners and above the requisite
age for military duty. It was quite a pastime
for me to hear them discuss among themselves
the politics of that day, for be it understood
they were not exactly a unit in sentiment
as regards secession. They were about equally
divided; some for the union, while those who
differed brought some of the most convincing
arguments to my mind to bear on the situation,
and although young in the cause of politics, I
was obliged to take sides with them, as a matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of right, as we saw it. Those who opposed did
not question our right, but differed as to the
policy pursued. They contended that we were
wrong in judgment as the sequel had proven.
In fact, we were not prepared for such tremendous
onslaughts as we had to meet, and we
believed and had reliance on our so-called
friends across Mason and Dixon line, which
proved to be as bitter as the rankest abolitionists.
One morning, Mr. Brantley came up and
brought the Georgian, a county news paper, saying,
"Hermann, your name is in this paper." I
said, "Is it?" "Listen."</p>

<p>"The following men are absent from their
Commands without leave, and should they not
immediately report for duty, they will be reported
as deserters: J. J. Sheppard, I. Hermann
and others whose names I have forgotten.
It was signed Captain Evan P. Howell, commanding
battery. I said, "Gentlemen, it is a
lie, and here is the proof, showing my sick furlough
from Dr. Paul Eve." Mr. Lyons then
spoke up, "Well, what are you going to do
about it?" I walked into cousin Abe's store,
took a sheet of paper and addressed, Mr. J. N. G.
Metlock, Editor of the Sandersville Georgian,"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>
"My dear sir:&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p>In perusing your previous issue I noted Capt.
Evan P. Howell's advertisement, which among
others I was named as one absent without leave,
and should I not report immediately to my command,
he would publish me as a deserter. Now
in simple justice to myself, I wish to inform
Capt. Howell, as well as the public, that his
statement is false, that I have a furlough granting
me leave of absence and that under no consideration
would I be away from my command,</p>

<div class="right">
Very respectfully,<br />
I. Hermann.<br />
</div>

<p>
At Home.<br />
</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;Please forward copy of your next issue
to Captain Howell and charge expenses to me."</p>
</div>

<p>I returned to my friends and said, "Gentlemen,
this is my reply, and when my time is up,
I shall report, either to Dr. Paul Eve, or Captain
Howell." Colonel Sol Newsome tapped
me on the shoulder, saying, "Hurrah, Hurrah
for you, Hermann." In a few days later, Sergeant
W. H. Hines, and four men of my Company
came to arrest me. I said to them, "You
can't do it as long as I have authority to remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
here," and showed them my furlough, which
lacked about two weeks of having expired. They
were all glad I was properly fixed and so
expressed themselves. They were also glad of
the opportunities they had to call upon their
respective families, which they would not have
had otherwise.</p>

<p>From Fenns Bridge I went to Macon to spend
a few days with a cousin who lived there. As I
walked the street one named Colson who
belonged to the Provost Guard came up saying,
"Ike old fellow, I have orders to arrest you."
"What for, Colson?" He answered, he did not
know. "Who gave you the orders?" He said
"Major Roland." "Let us go up and see him."
We walked up from Cherry Street to Triangular
block, where Roland, who was commander
of the Post, had his headquarters. The room
was full of men and officers, among whom I recognized
Captain Napier, who had lost a limb in
Virginia; the rest were all strangers to me.
Major Roland addressed himself to me "What
can I do for you?" "You had me arrested."
Colson was standing there; I looked at him; he
said "You gave me the orders." "What is your
name?" "Isaac Hermann." Roland brightened
up; "You are the fellow I was after; you are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
reported as a deserter." I pulled my furlough,
which was somewhat dilapidated from constant
wear and tear; he scrutinized it closely, handing
it back to me, saying, "This paper is forged;
some brother countryman fixed it up for you."
"You are a liar," I said. Quick as lightning
he grabbed and drew his sword, which was lying
on the table, exclaiming as he faced me, "I am
an officer." In the meantime I executed a half
about, drawing my pistol, saying: "I am a private;
if you make a move I'll put daylight
through you." And there we stood, facing each
other for a few seconds, when one of the officers
in the room approached me, saying in a whisper,
"Put up your pistol, I am your friend."
"Who are you?" "I am Paton Colquitt, Colonel
of the 46th Ga. Reg't., stationed at
Charleston, S. C., I am on my way to my command,
but intend now to remain to see you out."
I extended my hand and he shook it heartily.
Major Roland looked very pale; the rest of the
company present looked on with interest.
Roland ordered a Sergeant and four men as a
guard to escort me to the guard house. I said
"I'll die first, right here, before I'll march
through Macon, guarded like a horse thief. I
have not done anything to be arrested for; I
am known in Macon and will not submit to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
such indignity." Colonel Colquitt stepped up
to the table, saying, "Will you take me as sponsor
for this gentleman, to report at any place
you may designate, without a guard?" Roland
could not refuse, so trembling he wrote me (a
billet de logement): "To the Officer in Command
at the Calaboose: Admit the Bearer. By
order of Major Roland, Commanding Provost
Post, Macon, Georgia." Before calling at the
prison I passed to where my cousin lived. I
stated what had happened, so that she would not
look for me, as I was stopping at her house.
She was much distressed and feared personal
harm would befall me. I reassured her the best
I knew how and requested her to let me have a
blanket, if she could spare one, so that I could
sleep on it that night. I rolled the blanket, tied
the ends together with a string and drew it
across my shoulder. On the way I thought of
the threat Captain Howell made at Bryant
County, Camp Arnold, when Sergt. Hines
reported to me what he said, that he would get
me yet. I was mad; I was honor bound to report
at the calaboose. Col. Colquitt was my sponsor,
I could not go back on him. Finally I
arrived at the prison, an old building, about
25 by 40; it might have been used as a stable.
I presented my ticket for admittance, the officer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
looked at it, read it, then looked at me and
smiled, and said, "Well, this is unusual." I
disengaged myself of the blanket, as he unlocked
the door. The room was packed with men,
among them some Yankees, or some in Federal
uniforms. As the door was locked behind me
one of the inmates hollowed. "There is a new
comer, he must sing us a song;" I remarked,
I rather felt like fighting than singing just now,
when a big strapping fellow presented himself,
with his coat off, saying, as he put himself in a
fighting attitude, "Here is your mule;" I answered
as I hit him, "Here is your rider." I
struck him such an unexpected blow that it
stunned him, when he said he had enough,
as I was to double him. He apologized, saying
he was just funning; I answered and
said, "I meant it, and you believe it now;
I am obliged to you for having given me
this opportunity, for I have been badly
treated." I need not say that I was respectfully
treated by the rest of the inmates. And
while room to lay down was at a premium, I had
all I needed for that purpose. The following
morning at the break of day, my name was
called at the wicket; I answered. The door
swung open and there stood Col. Colquitt, smiling.
"Well, you are a free man"; "How did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
you do it!" "Ask me no questions and I'll tell
you no lies." I said, "Let me get my blanket
I borrowed on the way." He answered: "The
train that will carry me to my regiment will
leave in half an hour, and I have done what I
intended before going; I wish I had a thousand
men like you, and I would walk through Yankeedom."
I thanked him heartily for what he
said and did, promising never to forget it, and
I never have. We walked some distance together,
the atmosphere was chilly, and I proposed to
him if he would accept a treat from me in the
way of a drink; he said, "With great pleasure."
We found a place on our way to the depot,
which was not very far, as the Calaboose was
situated a little back of the Brown House, and
we drank a drink of as mean potato whiskey,
the only kind the men had, at one dollar a dram,
that was ever distilled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>


<p>As matters now stood, I was determined
not to return to my Company until I was
entirely recovered to my usual health. So
I reported to Dr. Green in charge of the
Floyd House Hospital for treatment. He
asked me what was the matter with me; I told
him I did not know. He stripped me and made
a thorough examination, and when he got
through he said, "You have an enlargement of
the heart, and ought not to be exposed." He
prescribed for me, and I reported to him daily
until my furlough had expired. I felt a great
deal better and was about ready to return to
my command, but Dr. Green advised me not to
do it yet awhile. I said, "My furlough is out;"
He said, "That does not make any difference,
you are under my charge for the present." In
the meantime Major Roland was removed as
Commander of the Post at Macon and Col.
Aiken was appointed in his stead. While in the
Hospital I made myself useful, and Dr. Green
appointed me General Ward-Master. My duties
were to look over the entire wards and see that
those under me did their duty, and that all
inmates were properly attended to. One good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
morning Sergt. Haywood Ainsworth came to
me, saying, "Ike I have in my possession a letter
for the Commander of the Post, Col. Aiken,
from Capt. Evan P. Howell; he is giving you the
devil; he sent me after you. If you go with me
to the command I will not deliver it." I said,
"Haywood, do you know what he writes in that
letter?" "No, not exactly, but it is very
severe." "I'd like to see what he says."
"Have you seen Col. Aiken; does he know
you?" No. "I will tell you what we will do;
you give me the letter and I will deliver it
myself; you can see that I do it, he will not know
me from you, as he does not know either of us."
Ainsworth laughed and says, "Well as you
say." So we both marched up to the Provost
Marshal's office. Col. Aiken was sitting in a chair
at his desk. I walked up to him, gave him the
military salute, handed him the letter and took
my position behind his chair, looking over his
shoulder as he read the letter. Capt. Howell did
not at all times write a very legible hand for one
not used to his writing; hence I being used to it,
got through before the Colonel did, I took a little
step to my left and rear, awaiting Col.
Aiken's orders. "Sergeant, where is the man?"
asked he. "He is in the Floyd house hospital,
in charge of Dr. Green." "Is he sick." "I suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
so." "Then he is under proper authority, I
can do nothing in this case, as it stands. You
go and see Dr. Green and ask him if Hermann
is well enough to be discharged and go to
camp. If so and he refuses to go, come to me
and I will give the necessary assistance required."
I thanked him, saying, "Col. I do not
think there will be any necessity for me to
trouble you further," and Haywood and myself
left, laughing all the way. Sergt. Ainsworth
then said, Well Ike, you are a good one, I know
you won't give me away. I said, You surely
do not think that of me. Oh no! I have all confidence
in you. Well, what are you going to do?
I will go back with you; I shall face the gentleman
and tell him what I think of him. What
was in the letter, what did he say? He stated
in the letter that I was a very desperate character;
that I left in time of battle; that he had
used all his efforts to get me back to my command,
and had failed. To please give Sergt.
Ainsworth all necessary assistance to accomplish
that object. Continuing, I said, Haywood,
you like to go home; so do I. Suppose we go
to Washington county for a few days, say until
Friday. You living in town put a notice in the
paper, stating that you will return to our camp
which is now at Dalton, and will take pleasure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
in forwarding anything that may be sent to the
boys from their friends and families. Sergt.
Ainsworth said, That is a good idea. I said,
Well I will meet you at Tennille Friday on the
night train. But before we go, I must have the
approval of Dr. Green, under whose charge I
now am; so we went to see Dr. Green: I
stated to him that I would like to return to my
command. He said, You are not well enough
to do camp duty. I said, Well, under circumstances
as they are, I am willing to take my
chances. I stated to him the facts as they were,
in the presence of Sergt. Ainsworth, who coincided
to everything I said. Then I remarked,
Doctor, you have been very kind to me, and
done me lots of good, for which I am very grateful,
but I can't rest under such imputation; I
intend to straighten matters out. So he said,
Well, if I can do anything for you or be any
service to you, let me know what it is and I will
be glad to do it. I said, All I want is for you
to give me a statement under what condition I
placed myself under your care, and the date of
my admittance and discharge, and your opinion
as to my present condition for active service.
He said he would do that, he would make
a statement and have it ready in an hour. In
the meantime Sergt. Ainsworth and myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
took a stroll through the city. I told my relatives
and friends good bye. We returned to the
hospital, they were all sorry I left them. Doctor
Green gave me the papers I required, I put
them in my pocket unopened. He said, If there
is anything else you need, let me know. I
thanked him very kindly, and we left for Washington
county. Sergt. Ainsworth said to me,
Dr. Green seems to think a great deal of you;
he seems to be a perfect gentleman. I said, Yes,
everybody who comes in contact with him likes
him; he is a very conscientious Doctor and
is very attentive to his business. Friday night
I took the train at Davisboro; I had about a
dozen boxes for the boys in camp, under my
charge at Tennille. Sergt. Ainsworth met me
with as many more boxes, and we travelled to
Dalton; it took us two nights and a day to get
there. It was Sunday morning early, when we
reached camp. The boys were all glad to see
us, we delivered our trust and there was plenty
of good things to eat in camp, in consequence of
our forethought. During my absence from camp
Dr. Stewart was transferred and Dr. Beauchamp
took his place. I had never seen him
before, so I at once reported to him, gave him
my papers from Dr. Green and he at once
relieved me from active duty. Then I stated to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>him why I had returned to camp, and the feud
that existed between Capt. Howell and myself,
and what he had done and said. So I was
determined to face the worst. I walked about
that day among the boys in camp, all of whom
were my friends; if I had an enemy in camp
outside of Capt. Howell, I did not know it.
About four o'clock p. m. I bethought myself
since I was not arrested after the awful charges
having been made against me, I had probably
better report my presence, although every one
in camp, Captain included, knew I was there.
So I just met Sergt. Hines, being very intimate
with him, I said, Bill, you want to have some
fun? Come with me, I am going to report at
headquarters; since all that hullabaloo I am
still unmolested. The officers quarters were
about one hundred yards up on a ridge from
where the pieces were parked. Capt. Howell
was sitting in front of his tent. I gave him the
salute, saying, Well, here I am. He answered,
I thought I never would see you again. I said
probably you would not, if it had not been for
some d&mdash;&mdash;d lies written to Col. Aiken, Provost
Marshal at Macon. Who wrote them? Capt.
Evan P. Howell, Comdg. Battery. If you think
that I am afraid of powder and ball, try me ten
steps. Do you mean it as a challenge? You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
are an officer; I am a private; it is for you to
construe it as you see fit. I'll have you court-martialed
and shot. I dare you to do it. In the
meantime Sergt. Hines was swinging to my
jacket and we withdrew. So Hines said, If
I had known that you would get mad that way
I would not have come with you. So I remarked,
I wanted you to come and be a witness, as to
what should pass between him and me. A half
hour later Sergt. Hines came to me, saying, Ike,
you are on duty tonight. By whose orders?
Capt. Howell's. I said, It is not a rule to put a
man on guard duty who had passed two nights
in succession without sleep, he might fall asleep
on his post. However, I did not come here to
do duty, I merely came to see what punishment
Capt. Howell would inflict on me, as he stated
that I deserted; and again, I am relieved from
duty by Dr. Beauchamp. Sergt. Hines made his
report. I saw Capt. Howell hastily walk over to
Dr. Beauchamp's quarters and expostulated
with him as to my ability of doing duty, thus
impugning the Doctor's capacity as a physician,
he who after a thorough examination having
passed on my condition; I heard Dr. Beauchamp
speaking in a loud voice: "Capt. Howell,
if you would attend to your duty as faithfully
as I do mine you would get along better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
with your men." Howell replied that he would
have me examined by a Board of Physicians.
That's all right, that is exactly what Hermann
asked me to have done and I have already set
him down to meet the Board at Dalton on next
Wednesday. In the meantime Dr. Beauchamp
treated me and I reported to him daily, when
able to be up; if not he came to my quarters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<p>Wednesday came, the day I was to report before
the Board; I was not feeling as well as I had
a day or so previous. I went to Bell, our ambulance
driver, saying Joe, I have to meet the
Board today at Dalton, you will have to carry
me there. He answered he could not do it as
he had orders from Capt. Howell to have the
ambulance ready for him, as he wanted to make
a social call, so I said no more. Dr. Beauchamp
who saw me walking about in camp, came
to me saying, I thought you were going to Dalton
today. I said I would go but Mr. Bell said
the Capt. engaged the ambulance to go on a
social call; I thought that vehicle belonged to
your department and is intended for the sick
only. So it is, says the Doctor, and I am going
to see about it. I said, Doctor, I do not feel
well enough to walk three miles and back today.
In a few minutes Joe Bell drove up with the
ambulance, saying, Ike, get ready, I will drive
you to town. So I went before the field Board
of Surgeons and Physicians. Dr. Beauchamp
had sent in his report of me, and I was pronounced
unfit for active duty and discharged
from service on account of ill health. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
action took me from under the jurisdiction of
Capt. Howell, greatly to my relief. I thanked
the Board, saying, Gentlemen, I enlisted for
the war, and at times I am able to do some duty.
There are other duties besides standing guard,
camping out and shooting. I am willing to do
anything I am able to do. About that time
Major Martin came in, undoubtedly sent there
by Capt. Howell. After speaking to the Doctors
he turned to me, we shook hands and he said,
Well Hermann, take good care of yourself, I
hope you will recover and get entirely well; you
have been badly treated, I am sorry to say.
Good bye. We again shook hands, he mounted
his horse and departed at a gallop. The Board
gave me an order to report to Gen. E. K. Smith,
who was then in Atlanta, doing post duty. He
asked me how long I had been on the sick list,
and I replied about three months. He said, Can
you do any office work; I answered I did not
know to what kind of work he would assign me
to. He said, Can you write? I told him yes;
so he put me to copying some documents, which
I did to his satisfaction. The desk at which he
put me to work was breast high and I had to
stand up. The following day I was suffering
so I could not do anything, and I had no more
medicine. The next day I felt worse. Dr. G.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
G. Crawford called in the office; he was in
charge of the fair ground hospital. General
Smith said, Doctor, what is the matter with
this man; since yesterday, he seems to be suffering
very much. Dr. Crawford spoke to me
and asked what my complaint was. I told him
I was suffering in my chest, and I was trying to
write at that desk and grew worse. He said,
You are a Frenchman! I said Yes. He said
he could tell it from my brogue. And he then
talked French to me and told me he studied
medicine in Paris, and having lived there myself
our conversation grew interesting to both
of us. So he turned to General Smith and said
General, I think I can help him considerably,
even if I can't cure him. So General said,
"Hermann, you go with Dr. Crawford, he will
take charge of you." And we left together for
the fair ground hospital, a temporary institution,
built of wood, roughly put up, consisting
of several wards, whitewashed in and out. I
found Dr. Crawford to be a perfect gentleman
and very interesting and we got along like
brothers; he was very kind to me. Under his
treatment I recuperated wonderfully and in a
couple of weeks I thought I was entirely cured.
I made myself as useful as possible, still continuing
my course of medicine. Dr. Crawford<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
appointed me to the same position I held under
Dr. Green at the Floyd hospital at Macon, and
he was well pleased with my work, as well as the
inmates of the hospital.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<p>General Bragg was removed from the command
of the army of Tennessee and Gen. Joseph
E. Johnston appointed in his place early in the
Spring of 1864. The campaign opened and Gen.
J. T. Sherman commanded the Federal forces.
His sanguinary and uncivilized warfare on the
defenseless is a matter of history. His careless
application of the torch, destroying by fire whatsoever
he could not carry off, leaving the old
and decrepit, the women and children to perish
in his wake as he marched through Georgia,
and reducing to ashes everything within his
reach, within a scope of territory fifty miles
wide by over three hundred miles long. Johnston's
army consisted of only about half the
strength of that of his antagonist, consequently
he adopted tactics by which he reduced Sherman's
army every time that General would
make an attack. Joseph E. Johnston acted all
along on the defensive, but was ever ready to
inflict severe punishment. When General Sherman
would force his lines of defense, thus General
Johnston generally ceded ground. While
his defeats were actual victories, as the cemeteries
along the line of his march indicate. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
hospitals were filling up with sick and wounded;
provisions became scarce, especially as our territory
became gradually contracted. So Dr.
Crawford came to me one morning, saying,
"Hermann, I want to send you out on a foraging
expedition. Do you think you can buy up
provisions for the hospital? I just drew my
allowance of $10,000.00; it wont buy much at
present prices." Yes, I can try and make it go
as far as possible. What do you say? I
remarked, Doctor, I will try and do my best.
So he gave me two packages of newly struck
Confederate money, all the way from $1,000.00
to $5.00 bills, more money than I had ever had
in my possession, and I was actually afraid to
carry such sums around with me, although I
knew it was not of much value. I also wanted
all the linen, lint and bandages that I could get.
I came to Washington county where I was
known; I put a notice in the weekly paper edited
by J. M. G. Medlock, setting forth my mission,
and that I would gladly receive any contribution
for the sick and wounded at the fair ground
hospital in Atlanta, under the charge of Dr.
Geo. G. Crawford, of the army of Tennessee,
and that I would pay the market price to any
who did not feel able to contribute the same free
of charge; that I would publish all contributions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
in the Central Georgian. I wrote to the Central
Railroad Company's office at Savannah, asking
them to kindly spare me two box cars, one at
Bartow and one at Davisboro, on a certain day,
when I would load them with provisions for the
hospital. The officials kindly offered me the
cars free of charge. It was on Thursday I
came to Bartow. Mr. Sam Evans, the agent,
gave me all his assistance, and provisions commenced
to rolling in. Mr. Warren from Louisville,
Ga., sent me four horse wagon loads of
flour from his mill, free of charge. Mr. Tarver,
a large planter, brought me a heavy load of
meats, chicken, eggs, butter, etc. Mr. B. G.
Smith also brought me a hogshead of hams,
shoulders and sides, the meat all nicely smoked,
and 100 pounds of leaf lard, chickens, eggs and
sweet potatoes, in fact the farmers of that section,
all well to do people and slave owners,
vied with each other as to who could do the most.
I filled up the car that day with the choicest provisions
which did not cost me a nickel. Many
poor women would bring me the last chicken
they had, and when I wanted to pay for the same
refused to take the money, and regretted they
could not do any more. They unraveled all the
old linen table cloth and brought me bags full of
lint and bandages. That night I forwarded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
car under special instructions by Mr. Evans
that it contained perishable goods, labeled for
the hospital in Atlanta. The following day I
went to Davisboro, Ga. W. C. Riddle, Simon
Thomas, Daniel Inman, Ben Jordan, Syl
Prince, Daniel Harris and others in that
neighborhood proved themselves as generous
and patriotic as the people of Bartow and
filled my car to overflowing with all kinds of provisions,
with the exception of one instance; in
regard to his worthy family I will withhold his
name. He was a well to do farmer and had a
profession. He was a hot secessionist and made
speeches to that effect. On the day of receiving
he came up in a fine buggy, with a bushel of
sweet potatoes. I said to him, What are they
worth? He answered, "Four dollars," I think
is what they are selling at. I paid the money
and he departed, and that was all the money
on the debit side of the $10,000.00. The same
was published as stated in the Georgian. I
returned to Atlanta with the last car of provisions
and when I alighted from the car the hospital
convalescents actually carried me on their
shoulders and would not let me walk. Dr. Crawford
looked on me in wonder when I returned
my account and gave him back the $10,000.00
minus $4.00, and said, Well that gives me money<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
to fix up my hospital as it should be. He bought
sheets and mattresses and had the hospital renovated
and made as comfortable as money could
make it. Under Dr. Crawford's treatment I
again became strong and the paroxysms of pain
gradually gave way and became less frequent
until I really considered that I was a well man
again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<p>My cousin in Macon gave a little social
entertainment and sent me an invitation. I
showed the same to the Doctor, and he said,
Well go, I give you 48 hours. The following
morning I hurried to the Quartermaster with
my furlough for transportation by placing my
permission on his desk. The train just blew the
signal for departure; I picked up the transportation
and in my hurry left my furlough on the
desk. Between Atlanta and Griffin the guards
passed through the coaches to inspect all papers
of the passengers. When they came to me I
found my transportation in my side pocket
minus my forty-eight hours leave of absence. I
explained how it might have happened, and
hoped they would let me continue, but I was
requested to get off at Griffin, which I did, and
asked the guard to conduct me to the Provost
Marshal, so that I might explain, and he could
inform himself, never doubting but that he
would wire and inform himself of the correctness
of my statement and let me proceed.
Instead, he told me he had heard such
statements before and informed the guard to
be especially vigilant in regard to me, so I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
was conducted to an old livery stable that
served as a prison. This was in Dec. 1863. I
spoke to my guard if there was not a way by
which I could communicate with Dr. Crawford
in Atlanta; he said he did not know. I said,
Please tell the Provost to write to Dr. Crawford
about me. Presently one of the guards brought
me a broom, saying, It is a rule when a new
comer comes to make him sweep out the calaboose.
I said, Well this time you will have to
break your rule. Do I understand that you
refuse to comply? I certainly do. He went to
the Sergt. of the Guard and made his report
as to what passed between us. The Sergt. came
at once, saying I understand you refuse to
sweep out the calaboose. I certainly do; is it
for this which I am arrested? He said, Do you
know the penalty, sir? No, and I don't care,
was my reply. He remarked, You'll be bucked
and gagged for two hours. I again said, "You'll
have a nice time doing it." He answered. Not
so much talk; pull off your overcoat. I said, If I
do I'll make you feel sorry for it. All this occurred
while I was standing before the fire place,
with my hands behind me. In front of me about
five feet distance, stood a wooden bench. The
Sergeant stood between me and it. Calling
for the guard to come up, they asked him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
if they should bring their guns. He said
no, only one bring his gun. They came up.
When the Sergeant put his hand on me as
if to unbutton my coat. I had moistened
the knuckles of my fingers by passing them
between my lips, concentrated the muscles'
tension and struck the Sergeant over the
bridge of his nose, sending him sprawling backward
over the bench, his head hitting the pavement,
and I had to dodge to avoid his heels hitting
me under the chin. The man who had the
musket made a lunge at me. Fortunately I had
a memorandum book in my side pocket which he
hit and dented the leaves of it half way through.
I grabbed at the gun and caught it just at the
curve of the bayonet, close to the muscle, and
jerked it out of his hands. I made moulinets,
holding the gun by the barrel and bayonet, and
drove the whole guard, consisting of twelve
men, before me. One of them stopped at the
rack, close to the door, which was open, to reach
for a gun, when I hit him with the butt end on
the arm, just below the shoulder, and sent him
to the ground, falling as he went in the middle
of the street. The exit of the men out of the
guard house was so hasty it attracted the attention
of the populace so that in a very short
space of time a crowd had assembled before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
door, looking askance as to what had happened,
among which was a Lieut. Colonel, judging from
the ensign he wore. Advancing to me, who stood
quietly at the entrance, at parade rest, he,
undoubtedly thinking that I was the sentinel,
asked me what was the matter, what are the
casualties. I simply remarked, Nobody hurt on
my side, Colonel. What is all this assemblage
here doing? So I explained to him what had
happened and the cause of it. He asked me
where were the guards. I pointed out some of
them in the crowd; they gradually approached.
He asked some of them to lead him to the Provost
Marshal, whose name was Capt. Willis,
which gentleman (pardon the expression) he
berated to the utmost, telling him that he was
not fit for a hog herder much less to be in command
of human beings, who ever heard of bucking
and gagging in the Confederate Army. I
am going to report you to the proper authorities,
and he ordered him to send me back to
Atlanta by the next train, so that I might prove
my assertion. The train from Macon to Atlanta
was due within half an hour, so I was sent back
under guard of a Lieutenant and four men with
loaded muskets, with orders to shoot should I
make an effort to escape. Luckily in my school
days, which were close to an army post, I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
twice a week to the armory to take lessons in
boxing and sword exercise, and while I do not
profess to be an expert in those sciences, they
served me tolerably well in the above stated
instance, and others through which it has been
my misfortune to pass. Arriving in Atlanta, I
was conducted to the Provost Marshal. The
Lieutenant in command of the guard handed
him a letter which the Provost read, after which
he looked at me, standing in the middle of the
room, and said, Well Lieutenant, I'll take
charge of the prisoner; you can go back by the
next train. The Lieutenant saluted him and he
and his guard departed. It was between four
and five o'clock in the afternoon. There were
two more men at the office at their desks, and
they soon left the room, leaving me and the
Provost by ourselves. Turning to me he said,
You belong to Walker's Brigade? I said, Yes,
Howell's Battery. He said, Well I thought I
knew you. He said, Well you got in a h&mdash;&mdash;l of
a scrape. I answered that I did not know that
a man losing his furlough was so criminal. He
looked up at me in surprise, saying, This is not
what you are charged with; you are charged
with striking a superior officer; do you know the
penalty? Yes, shot if found guilty. What did
you do it for? About that time I had been eyeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
my questioner all along, I thought I knew
him but I could not place him. He was Capt.
Beebee of a South Carolina Regiment. I
answered him thus, "Well, Captain, I fought
for the rights of the Confederacy for the last
three years and thought five minutes for myself
was not too much." I explained to him all of
the circumstances leading to my present condition.
He exclaimed, "My God, why did you not
kill him?" I said I did my best, I only got one
lick at him and I give him a good one. He said
Go over to the quartermaster's and see if you
find your papers; if not I will give you some
that will carry you through. I ran across the
street, asking the quartermaster if I did not
leave my furlough on his desk that morning.
He opened a drawer and handed me my paper.
I thanked him and reported my find to Capt.
Beebee, who said, I know you are alright, you
can go. We shook hands and I went my way to
the fair ground hospital for the night to make a
new start in the morning. Dr. Crawford seeing
me said, I thought you had gone to Macon. I
answered that I had gone a part of the way and
was brought back under guards. How was
that? So I recounted to him all the circumstances
and illustrated with a musket the picture
of the guard getting out of my reach. Dr.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Crawford laughed till he cried. Well you had
a time of it, said he. I sure did, and half of my
permit is out. He said, Well go and stay as long
as you like it, but not too long. He wrote me
another permit and I again made for the train
leading to Macon. This time the guard did not
come aboard inspecting papers, but the train
on arriving at Griffin was entered by the guards
and papers were shown. I was sitting by the
window of my coach when I heard some one say
"Sergt. there is the fellow, the same fellow,"
pointing at me. I had not noticed the Sergt. at
first as I was looking above and beyond him,
and I saw him standing right close beside the
train, in front of the window. I put out my
head to speak to him; he had a bandage around
his forehead and both of his eyes were inflamed
and discolored. I said to him, Sergt. are you
hurt? He did not reply, so I said, I am sorry
for you, the next time you want to have some
fun in the bucking, gagging line you try some
one else who likes that kind of sport better than
I do. The train departed and nobody even
looked at my papers that day. I arrived at
Macon a day after the feast, but had a pleasant
day anyhow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>


<p>Before the battle of Resaca Dr. Crawford was
ordered to move his hospital further into the
interior, so he located at Vineville, a suburb of
Macon. He pitched his buildings in front of
Mr. Burrell Jordan's premises and sent me
again on a foraging expedition. I came again
home to Washington County, expecting to make
headquarters at the home of Mr. Benjamin G.
Smith, where I was always welcome. Mr. Smith
however, at that time seemed to be very much
disturbed and not in his usual pleasant and
cheerful mood. I asked him the cause of his
troubles; he handed me a slip of paper just
received from Lieut. Stone, recruiting agent at
Sandersville, to be sure and report without fail
at Sandersville on the following Thursday to be
mustered into service. Mr. Smith was a widower;
his wife had died a couple of years previous,
leaving him an only daughter about four
years old. Mr. Smith was the owner of about
one hundred slaves and a very large plantation.
He remarked to me, Hermann, I do not mind
going to the front, but what is to become of my
dear little Jenny among all those negroes; this
is more than I can stand. Mr. Smith was a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
benefactor to the indigent widows and orphans,
and soldiers' families. He contributed unstintedly
to the wants of those at home whose male
persons were at the front fighting the battles
of their country; in fact he ran his whole plantation
in their interest, making thousands of
provisions which he distributed among them as
they stood in need and without remuneration.
This was the period of the war when everybody
able to bear arms was called to the front, and
the saying was, "The Government is robbing
the cradle and the grave." Sherman was advancing;
Johnston was falling back; the people
were clamorous for a test fight, General Johnston
could not see the advantage of the same
and still kept retreating. The battle of Kennesaw
mountain was hotly contested, with
severe punishment to the enemy but Johnston
withdrew and thus fell back to the gates of
Atlanta. Referring again to Mr. Smith, I told
him I thought I had a solution to his troubles.
I said, Carry your little girl to Mrs. Francis,
your sister; she will take care of her. This is
only Tuesday, we will run up to Macon tonight,
and I will plead your cause before Governor
Brown, who had established his headquarters
there. I think it worth a trial anyway, you can't
lose anything by it anyhow. This was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
3 o'clock p. m. He at once gave orders to his
cook to boil a ham and make biscuits and that
night about midnight we took the train to
Macon, Ga. We took breakfast at my cousin's
and repaired to the Governor's headquarters.
I saw the Governor in front of a table, examining
some papers. I said, This is Governor
Brown? He said Yes, what will you have? I
introduced myself, stating that I was a member
of Howell's Battery, and that on account of disabilities
was relieved from duty and assigned
by Dr. Crawford as foraging agent. I related
the condition of Mr. Smith and his surroundings,
saying, That man is worth as much at
home as a regiment at the front. The Governor
at once wrote on a sheet of paper, handing
it to Mr. Smith, said, Hand this to the enrolling
officer. It was an exemption from military duty.
We took our leave, thanking the Governor. Mr.
Smith was so overcome with the fact that I had
never seen such emotion displayed by a man;
tears ran down his cheeks; his thoughts concentrated
on his "Sis" as he called his little
daughter Jenny.</p>

<p>Mr. Smith lived to a ripe old age. He was of
a very benevolent disposition. He was a religious
man but not a fanatic, quick answering and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
very charitable. Many now prosperous and
substantial citizens owe their start in life to
his munificence. He was as gentle as a woman
but as firm as a rock in his convictions. In his
death Washington County has sustained an
irreparable loss and the State a true and loyal
citizen.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>


<p>General Joseph E. Johnston was removed
from command and General John B. Hood was
appointed in his stead. Dr. Crawford was
ordered to remove to Montgomery, Ala. In
reference to the battle of Resaca I omitted to
state that I received a letter from my friend
B. S. Jordan, whom I had appointed as local
agent to forward supplies for the general hospital,
that his brother, Jas. P., a Capt. in the
57th Ga. Regt., and a dear friend of mine, was
dangerously wounded. I at once set out in
quest of him and found him lying on a pallet on
the platform of the depot. He was suffering, but
when he saw me he brightened up. I said, poor
fellow, are you wounded badly? He said, Yes,
and indicated the place. Now I have to refer to
a little incident that transpired at the time when
Capt. Jordan had organized a Company and
was about to leave for the front: This was in
1862. When I had already experienced one
year's service in the 1st Ga. Regiment. I said,
Well, James, don't you let me hear of you being
shot in the back. He was indignant. Never,
replied he, emphatically. But when he indicated
his wound, I remarked at once: Shot in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
the back, as I expected. Suffering as he was,
he laughed heartily and said I want to explain;
I said, No explanation is necessary, the evidence
is before me. He remarked, Yes, but
I want to explain how it was done. I said
evidently by a musket ball in the hands of
a Yankee, and so I teased him until he
nearly forgot all about his wound, which was
in the fleshy part of his hip. Captain James
P. Jordan was of a noble and chivalrous
disposition and his Company had seen much
hard service. He explained that they were
ordered forward on a double quick to charge
the enemy in their immediate front, when owing
to some obstructions his Company got out of
line, turning towards them to align them a ball
had struck him and he was carried to the rear.
I carried him to the Vineville hospital. Dr.
Crawford extracted the ball, and when his Uncle
Burrell heard of his being there he had him
removed to his home and well taken care of.</p>

<p>It must be remembered matters were getting
very squally; every available man and boy was
called to the front. The battle of Atlanta was
fought and lost at a great sacrifice to both sides,
on July 21st, 1864, Gen. W. H. T. Walker on
our side, General McPherson on the Federal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
side, were both killed. The City was sacked
and laid into ruins as a result of the most uncivilized
warfare. General Hood changed his tactics,
and after the engagement at Jonesboro he
swung to Sherman's rear, expecting by that
move to cut off Sherman's supplies and reinforcements,
and Sherman having now no army
in front to oppose him marched through the
length of Georgia by rapid strides to the sea,
Savannah being his objective point.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<p>The prisoners at Andersonville, amounting
to many thousand, owing to their Government
refusing to exchange them, preferring to let
them die in their congested condition rather
than to release those of ours, caused untold
hardships on those unfortunate fellows. Their
own Government even refused to furnish them
with the requisite medical relief and medicine
which became unobtainable on account of the
close cordon of blockaders guarding our ports
of entry. It must be remembered that while we
on the Confederate side had only seven hundred
thousand available men, in round numbers, in
every branch of the service, our adversary had,
according to statistics, two million, seven hundred
thousand men in the field, and while we had
exhausted all our resources they still had the
whole world to draw from. Neither were they
particular then, as now, as to what kind of emigrants
landed in Castle Garden or Ellis Island,
but they accepted the scum of the world, paying
fifteen hundred dollars bounty as an incentive
to enlist in their army. Such were the conditions
in the latter part of 1864. General Wheeler's
Cavalry was the only force that swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
close to Sherman's flanks, thus keeping his columns
more compact and preventing them from
doing more depredations than they did. Even
as it was, they lived on the fat of the land, and
as stated, wantonly destroyed what they could
not carry along, to the detriment of the defenceless
women and children.</p>

<p>Dr. Crawford was ordered to remove his hospital
to Montgomery, Alabama. I was out foraging;
I was at Davisboro, Station No. 12,
Central R. R. when a train load of the Andersonville
prisoners stopped at the station. The
train consisted of a long string of box cars.
Davisboro was not then the prosperous little
city it is now; it consisted of only one dwelling
and outhouses usually attached to a prosperous
plantation, and a store house; it was owned
by Mrs. Hardwick, the great grandmother of
our now Congressman, T. W. Hardwick, an
elderly widow lady, who for the accommodation
of the railroad kept an eating house where the
train hands would get their meals as the trains
passed on schedule time. Curiosity led me to
approach the train, which was heavily guarded
by sentinels stationed in the open doors and on
top of the cars, with loaded muskets, to prevent
escapes, when I heard the grand hailing words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
of distress from an inmate of the car. Being a
Mason, I demanded what was wanted, when
some one appealed to me, "For God's sake give
me something to eat, I am starving to death;
somebody stole my rations and I have not eaten
anything for three days." Being meal time I
at once run in the dining room of the Hardwick
House, picked up a plate with ham and one with
biscuits, and ran to the train, called on the man
in Masonic terms, and handed him the provisions
that I had wrapped up in a home made
napkin, bordered with indigo blue. It was seven
o'clock p. m. and one could not distinguish the
features of an individual; it was a starless,
foggy night. After the train left I entered the
house and excused myself for the rudeness of
taking the provisions as I did. Mrs. Hardwick
not having been in the dining room at the time
I explained to her that my obligations were
such that I had to render assistance to any distressed
Brother Mason; he applying to me as
such; "I am now ready to pay you for all the
damages I did," and this was her reply: "I
don't charge you anything honey, I am glad you
did it." But not so with her housekeeper, Miss
Eliza Jackson, who berated me for everything
she could think of, saying, "They had no right
to come here and fight us; you are nothing but a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Yankee yourself," etc., etc. Miss Jackson was
a long ways beyond her teens, so I said, "Miss
Liza, you are mad, because owing to the war
your chances for marriage have greatly diminished,
especially with the disposition you have."
Those present enjoyed her discomfiture.</p>

<p>Usually when troops were about to be ordered
in transit, they were issued three days rations,
all of which were often walloped out of sight
at one square meal on account of its meagerness;
undoubtedly that is what happened to my
Masonic Brother; he received his rations and
someone stole them. I myself often ate at one
meal what was intended to last me three days
and trusted for the future. I never felt any
remorse of conscience to get something to eat,
if I could; I felt that the people for whom I
devoted my services in those days owed me a
living, and when the authorities failed to supply
it, I took it where I could find it.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>


<p>I rejoined Dr. Crawford and he sent me out
again. I took the train to Greenville, Alabama,
and walked about eight miles to Col. Bowens',
who was an uncle of Mrs. John George. Mrs.
George was a niece of Mrs. Braswell, where I
boarded. She came to spend many days with
her Aunt while I was with the family; her
home was only about three miles distant.
She married Mr. George and moved to Butler
County, Alabama. Mr. Bowen, her uncle,
furnished me with a horse and I rode
out to see them. Butler county is a sort
of an out of the way place, and that country
had not been overrun with soldiers, and provisions
were plentiful. When I hollowed at the
gate she recognized me at once and was overjoyed;
she took me around the neck and kissed
me. George ran out saying, "Mollie! Mollie!
What are you doing." She said, "Never mind
that is home folks." Poor woman, she was so
overcome to see someone from home that she
actually cried for joy. They were a happy family.
I gave them all the news about their people,
as I had just come from there. I stated
my business and both of them set in the following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
day to assist me in my duty. Butler county,
where they lived was a very hilly country, but
tolerably thickly settled, and provisions came
in by the quantities. I, with the assistance of
my host and hostess, filled a single box of eggs
six by three feet long and three feet high. We
stood every one on its end with alternate layers
of bran and sawdust and carried them over a
very rough road to Greenville, together with a
great many chickens and shipped them to the
hospital, and we only lost three dozen eggs by
breakage. One morning we heard the report
that the enemy, in great force, was approaching.
People were leaving the city. With the exception
of a small garrison there was no defense.
Dr. Crawford had to abandon the city, removed
all that were in condition to get away, but there
were about a half a dozen men who were too sick
to be removed. The enemy came into the city
soon after we left. Dr. Crawford remarked to
me that evening, "Herman, I am going to send
you back to take charge of the hospital and those
poor fellows that I could not get away." I
demurred, saying that I did not care to be taken
prisoner. He said, "Listen; In all civilized
warfare the medical department is exempt from
molestation." I said, "From the way this war
is waged it is not altogether civilized, but I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
under your orders; I'll do what you want me to
do." He said, "I'll take it as a great favor;
I can't abandon those poor fellows, some one
has to take care of them and administer to their
wants." He said he did not know where he
would locate but wherever he went I must come
back to him. I was then about nine miles from
Montgomery. It was late in the evening, and I
took it afoot back. When passing through
Macon on my way to Montgomery, I passed a
night with my cousin, Mrs. Wurzbourg, whose
husband was exempt from military duty on
account of physical infirmity. My jacket which
I wore was threadbare, and even (holy). He
presented me with one of his blue flannel sack
coats. I had previously been able, through Dr.
Crawford, to get enough cloth for a pair of
pants and vest. It was blockade goods which
the Government had purchased, and it was
of a coarse textile, and of a light blue cast,
and thus I was fairly decently clothed. In
those days the Confederate grey was very
much lacking, and men, as well as women,
had to wear anything, of any color they
could get hold of. So after leaving Dr. Crawford,
to return to the hospital at Montgomery,
I stopped over at a cottage. The proprietor
had a watch repair and jewelry shop in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Montgomery, who owned a small plantation
about six miles from the city. He had left the
city for lack of business, and now lived at his
country home. He was an Englishman, his wife
was French. This book being written entirely
from memory, after a lapse of about a half a
century, I can't remember the names of those
people, but they were very kind and hospitable.
After supper we repaired to their little parlor.
The house was well kept, and proved that the
mistress of the same knew how to manage a
home and make it comfortable. There was a
piano, and I asked the lady, (talking French to
her), if she would kindly play a little. So she
asked me if I could sing some French songs; I
said a few. She at once repaired to the instrument,
and asked me what will you have. I of
course called for the Marseillaise, which she performed
to perfection. So she asked me to sing;
I started the melody of</p>

<div class="poem">
Adieu Patrie<br />
France Cherie<br />
Ou Chaque jour<br />
Coulait si pure<br />
Mon helvretie<br />
Douce et jolie<br />
Pays d'Amour<br />
O ciel d azure<br />
Adieu, Adieu!<br />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>Having finished that stanza I noticed she had
quit playing and was crying; so I remarked,
"Madam, had I known that my singing would
have had such an effect I surely would not have
sung." By way of explanation she remarked
that her first husband was a composer and that
the song I sang was his first effort and he
received a prize on it. Oh those were happy
days she said! Her husband talked very kindly
to her and the general conversation turned on
France and of days gone by. She had lived in
Paris and knew many business houses that I
knew and I passed a most pleasant night. The
following morning I sat down to a substantial
country breakfast. We had hardly finished when
the negro servant ran in, saying, "Master the
Yankees are coming. They are here." Looking
up the road, sure enough, a few hundred
yards beyond where the road turned, they were
in view. I at once, on the first impulse, jumped
into a closet. Hardly was I in, closing the door,
when I thought of this being the first place they
would examine. I opened the door, and not
knowing where to go I went into the back yard,
between the house and the smoke house. Hardly
had I done so when a dozen or more Yankees left
their column entered the house very boisterously.
Being dressed somewhat like they were,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
in blue, lacking but the brass buttons, I entered
the back door, unconcernedly, mixing among
them without being detected or noticed. Some
of the men had placed their guns in the corner
of the room; when of a sudden my hostess run
in by the back door, crying, "My God! They
are taking all of my meat." I don't know what
impelled me but I seized a gun from the corner,
ran out of the back door, brought my weapon
from a trail to a support, and ordered the two
men to throw back the hams each of them had
in their grasp, one of which acted at my command,
and the other said, What in the h&mdash;&mdash;l
you got to do with it. Before I could reply his
comrade said to him, "Throw it down, don't
you see he is a safe guard;" he threw down the
hams. I took the cue from what the Yankee
said, although it was the first time I had heard
of a safe-guard. The door of the dwelling wide
open, those in the house saw me walk the post
back and forth, made their exit and left the
house, and as long as I was guarding, no more
Yankees tarried on the premises; they came,
looked about and left the premises as soon as
they saw me standing guard, until the whole
column had passed. My host came to me saying,
Well, they are all gone, thank God, I said
no, the rear guard has not passed. The dwelling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
house was constructed close to the ground,
leaving only about a foot space in front while
the rear end was about two and a half feet from
the ground. I took my gun and crawled under
the house. Presently there came what I thought
to be about a regiment, and several stragglers.
Finally I came from under the house. I gave
my hostess the gun I'd taken, telling her, If I
do not call for it it shall be yours. My host took
my hands, shook them heartily, saying, "You
are a hero;" I laughed, saying, Well, I saved
your bacon; Good bye; I am much obliged to
you for your kind hospitality, and if it had not
been for those fellows we would have had a good
time. I started on my philanthropic errand,
not knowing if I would find the sick men dead
or alive. I had gone but a few hundred yards
when I met a Federal soldier marching hastily
to catch up. He said, Are they far ahead; I
said, No, about five hundred yards or a quarter
of a mile. You are going the wrong way, said
he. I answered, I am not going far, I lost something.
Further on I met two more, who like the
first, took me for a Federal. One said, Comrade
you are going the wrong way. I said, I am not
going far. How far behind are we? I said, Not
far, a few hundred yards. And so within about
one and a half mile I met a dozen stragglers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
walking to catch up, all comparatively asking the
same questions, and to which I replied alike.
When about four hundred yards in front of me,
and about alike in the rear of the last straggler
I saw four horsemen, riding abreast, holding
their carbines by the barrel and resting the butt
on their thighs. I recognized them as Confederates.
I walked up to them, asking, What
troops do you belong to? Harvey's Scouts of
Forrests' Cavalry, was their reply. Are there
any others behind? Yes. How far? The rear
of the enemy's column is about two miles ahead
of you, said I, and there are about a dozen stragglers,
some with guns, and some have none;
they are separated several hundred yards apart,
some single and some in pairs; if you spur up
you can catch the whole gang; I'll tell those men
ahead of me to hurry up. Where is Capt. Harvey?
You'll find him in the Exchange Hotel,
in town. They at once put spurs to their horses
and galloped on, and I followed my course
towards the city. I met the reinforcements
some little distance ahead of me, and reported
what I had seen and told their advance scouts.
They all went at full speed, and later, I saw the
whole gang of stragglers brought in. I asked
Capt. Harvey what had become of the inmates
at the hospital. He said he did not know for he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
had just arrived that morning. I went to the
hospital, found things in rather bad shape and
the inmates gone. After careful investigation
I heard that the Ladies Relief Association had
taken care of the sick and that they were well
provided for.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>


<p>Dr. Crawford followed General Hood's army
and established headquarters at Corinth, Miss.
I followed at once, as soon as I could locate
him. I bought what provisions I could along
the stations. At Columbus, Miss., some Federals
who came there to tear up the track fired in
the train as we passed; several of the passengers
were wounded but General Forrest
appeared at that moment on the scene and
routed the enemy, killing and wounding quite a
number of them, and thus preventing the
wreckage of the railroad track. The car I rode
in was riddled with bullets, but I escaped
unhurt; several of the passengers had a close
call.</p>

<p>While at Corinth I was deputized to carry a
message to the front, this side of Franklin, Tennessee.
I arrived in time where General Beauford's
men had a brush with the enemy. A stray
bullet hit me in the thigh, and for a time I
thought I was seriously hurt. I was close to
a little stream of water. I had my leg tied above
the wound with my handkerchief and put it in
the running stream. A surgeon came to probe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
my wound, but trembled like a man having the
palsy, and I told him he must not touch me any
further; he could hardly put his probe in the
hole made by the bullet. After a while I was
picked up and sent to the rear where I was cared
for by Dr. Crawford, who was very sorry and
regretted having sent me. My wound was doing
so well and there was no inflammation taking
place, and by keeping cold applications on it I
was able to be about in less than two weeks. Dr.
Crawford said I did the best thing that could be
done by keeping inflammation down by putting
my leg in the stream. The wound did so well
that he would not bother it to extract the ball,
and so I still carry it as a memento of the war.
While at Corinth the ladies of Washington
county sent me a box. The battle of Franklin
was fought and a victory dearly bought. Two
weeks later the battle of Nashville was fought,
and General Hood's magnificent army nearly
annihilated. They came through Corinth the
worst conditioned men I ever laid my eyes upon.
There I met Lieut. John T. Gross of this County
and Capt. Joe Polhill of Louisville, Ga., and
about twenty of their command. They were
hungry and in rags; I said, "Boys, you are in a
bad fix." Capt. Polhill said, "Ike, can you tell
me where I can get something to eat; I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
starved." I said I had just heard that there
was a box in the depot for me, let us see what is
in it. I took the crowd up to the hospital and all
got something to eat. The hospital wagon went
to the depot and got the box. It was a large
box, and was filled to the top with clothes and
eatables. Lieut. Gross, who was barefooted,
I supplied with a pair of broken shoes. Many
of the provisions were cooked. I took out some
checked shirts and knit socks and a pair of
pants and jacket and divided the rest among the
boys, who were all from Jefferson and Washington
counties, and even to this day Capt Polhill
declares I saved his life. He is still one of
the Vets. and a useful and honored citizen of
Louisville, Ga.</p>

<p>Corinth at that time when I saw it, was only
a railroad station with an improvised station
house or warehouse. A few chimneys here and
there indicated where had previously stood
some houses. It is not far from the Tennessee
river, about ten miles from Shiloh, where Albert
Sidney Johnson, from Texas, was killed and
General Beauregard saved the day. During
my convalescence I walked over some of the battle
ground. Being tired I sat down on a log.
There were two logs touching each other lengthways.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
They had been large trees, about two and
a half to three feet in diameter. Playing on the
ground with my crutch I unearthed a bullet;
presently I scratched up another. I noted that
the logs were riddled with bullets. I picked up
over one hundred pounds of musket balls in a
space not over twenty-five feet square. How any
escaped such a shower of lead in such a small
place can't be possible. Undoubtedly those logs
had served as a protection behind which those
brave fellows sent forth in the ranks of their
adversaries a similar amount of death dealing
missiles.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>


<p>This brings us towards the last part of December,
1864. When General Hood planned his
campaign to the rear of General Sherman, instead
of following General Johnston's tactics
and thus leaving the balance of the State of
Georgia to the tender mercies of our adversaries,
who had no mercy or respect for age nor
sex, but wantonly destroyed by fire and sword
whatever they could lay their hands on, save the
booty and relics with which they were loaded.
Howell's battery, on account of their horses
being exhausted, could not follow General
Hood's army into Tennessee, and were ordered
to Macon to recruit. This Company had seen arduous
service from Chickamauga to Atlanta, including
Jonesboro. After the battle of Chickamauga,
one of the hardest contests of the war,
in which the confederate forces were successful,
Howell's battery had the honor to open the battle
from the extreme right, on the 18th day of
September, 1863. On the 19th, which was on
Saturday, the fight was progressing furiously,
with no results, both armies holding their own,
but on Sunday morning our forces centered their
attack on the enemy's center, charged through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
their lines and rolled them back in complete disorder,
and the victory was ours. General Bragg
rested his forces for a few days and renewed the
fight around Chattanooga, Lookout Mountain
and Missionary Ridge. He found the enemy
well fortified and ready. The battle was a sanguinary
one; Howell's battery besides losing
two pieces of artillery, which were recovered in
the evening and returned to us, lost in wounded,
Leonidas Hines, Frank Bailey and Corporal
Braswell, and captured James Mullen, John S.
Kelley, John Tompkins and John Braswell.
That night General Bragg withdrew as quietly
as possible and went into camp at Dalton, where
we spent in winter quarters. At Macon they did
provost duty under direction of General Howell
Cobb. The writer drifted back through Alabama
expecting to rejoin Dr. Crawford as soon
as he would locate, and being intercepted by
Federal troops I reported to the nearest Confederate
post, which proved to be General Beaufort
from Kentucky, a cavalry officer at Union
Springs, Alabama. General Abe Beaufort was
of colossal stature and an able officer, so I reported
to him for duty until I could join my
proper command. He said, Have you a horse?
We are cavalry. I said, No, but I expect to get
one the first fight we get into. He laughed and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
said, Well, you can hang around here. I stayed
at his quarters several days. One day he seemed
to be worried more than usual; I ventured to
say, "General, You seem to be worried over
something." He said, "I have enough to worry
about; there is General Forrest at Selma; I have
sent him two couriers and neither of them have
reported; I don't know what became of them,
whether they have been captured, killed or run
away. I want to hear from General Forrest so
that we can act in concert of action." The Federals
who held possession of Montgomery under
General Wilson's corps d'army, who later captured
President Jefferson Davis in Irwin County,
Ga., during the several days of my hanging
around at General Beaufort's Headquarters, he
asked me how long I had been in the service. I
said, "I joined the first Company that left my
county and the first regiment that left my
State." How long had you been in this country
before the war broke out? I answered that I
came to Georgia direct from France in the Fall
of 1859, about sixteen months before I enlisted.
I found in this country an ideal and harmonious
people; they treated me as one of their own; in
fact for me, it was the land of Canaan where
milk and honey flowed. In the discussion of the
political issues I felt, with those that I was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
contact with, that they were grossly imposed
upon by their Northern brethren and joined my
friends in their defence, and so here I am, somewhat
worsted, but still in the ring. I said, General
I have an idea; I think I can carry a dispatch
that will land. I have in my possession at
home my French passport. I can write for it
and use it by going squarely through their lines,
as being an alien. I can change my clothes for
some citizens clothes. After a little reflection
General Beaufort said, "Hermann, you are an
angel; it's the very idea." So we arranged to
write at once for my pass. It came in due time.
The lady of the house where the General kept
his quarters furnished me with a suit of jeans
cloth, but begged the General not to send me for
fear I might meet with reverses. But the General
said, He is all right, he can work the scheme.
That night I started about ten o'clock, on horseback,
with two escorts. It was a starlight night.
We passed for some distance through a dense
swamp. The General cautioned me to be careful
and on the lookout, an admonition I thought entirely
unnecessary. He said the enemy's camp
was about twelve miles distant, and that they
had a company of scouts out that night, and so
had we, but as we journeyed along at a walk the
lightning bugs were so thick as to blind a fellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and the swamp so dark that we could only designate
the road by the distance and open space of
the tree tops and the stars. We did not however,
meet any of the scouts. On emerging
from the swamp I noticed on my right a small
farm cottage and a dim light through the cracks
of the door. I dismounted, knocked at the door.
At first no one answered. I knocked again when
a lady's feeble voice answered, Who is there? A
friend, was the reply. Open the door please. The
door opened and there stood in front of me an
old lady of about seventy, I judged, nearly
scared to death, trembling from head to foot. To
re-assure her I said, Madam, we are Southerners
don't be frightened, we won't do you any harm.
Can you tell me how far it is from here to the
enemy's camp? She answered very excitedly
that she had nothing to do with the war, she is
only a lone woman and we can't cheat her out of
many years. You all have stolen all my meat
and did not leave me a mouthful of corn or meat,
and I am left here to starve to death. I said,
But we are Confederates; but I noticed the
woman did not believe me, undoubtedly owing
to my brogue, as there were thousands of foreigners
in the federal army. I lit a match and
scrutinized the ground and noted the doors of
the outhouse wide open, houses empty and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>ground churned into dust by the horses hoofs.
Undoubtedly we were not far from the enemy,
as they were there that day and looted the premises.
I bid the lady good night and joined my
escort who waited for me in the road. As I was
about to mount my horse I perceived ahead of
me through the limbs of the trees, a bright
light. The lady was still standing in the door,
and I asked her what that light was we saw
ahead of us. She said they were the negro
quarters about a quarter of a mile ahead, and I
thanked her and we moved a little forward and
held consultation as to what was best to do,
whether they should return to camp leading my
horse back and I to take it afoot or whether we
had better go together to the quarters, probably
they might get a few potatoes and some buttermilk,
for be it understood that we belonged to
the hungry army where rations became very
scarce, for as a rule the Confederate soldier
respected private property and often suffered
hunger rather than appropriate property belonging
to others. They concluded they might
buy something to eat from the darkies. The
negroes in those days, as before the war, always
had a surplus of provisions. They were well
fed, in fact most of them made their own provisions
with the exception of meat, their owner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
allowing them patches and giving them time to
cultivate the same for their own use or to sell
with their master's permission, which was generally
only a matter of form or respect.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>


<p>In keeping my eyes to the front watching the
light, we came to an open field on the right. On
the left of the road was a dense forest. I noted
some one crossing the light and heard some one
screaming and hollering like negroes carousing.
Presently the same person recrossed and
I thought there must be some Federals about
there and we stopped to consult. I concluded
that I would take it afoot and reconnoiter while
my escort would enter the woods where we stood
and wait for me until I returned. I took the
darker side of the road along the woods until I
arrived close to the premises, and I circumvented
the place. I noted a double pen log house
with a large chimney at one end and a rousing
lightwood fire in it. A step over fence about five
rails high surrounded the yard in which stood
a very large oak tree, the limbs of which hung
low, a little above a man's head. To those limbs
were hitched three splendid horses. In the
house were three Federals, enjoying their surroundings.
The house had a front and back entrance
and the fire in the chimney cast its light
some distance, front and rear, around the premises.
I hurried back to my comrades and made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
my report as above, and I suggested a line of
action as follows: We will leave our horses on
the road side, about two hundred yards this
side the house. One of us will enter the back
side as I enter the front, and one of you follow
me; Are you willing. If you do as I say we will
capture those fellows without firing a shot. The
youngest of the escort was a young man of about
19 years; the other was 21 years old. The
younger said, General Beauford told us to obey
your orders, and I am ready to do what you tell
me to do. I said, Bravo, my boy. The other
one was silent, I remarked, what do you say?
He tried to answer but his teeth chattered and
he was trembling so he could hardly speak. I
said, What is the matter with you, are you
scared? He said, No, I am excited. You must
compose yourself. If you follow my advice and
do exactly what I say and we will capture those
fellows without firing a gun, but there must be
no wobble, or they may turn the joke on us. I
told the youngest to hold his gun ready for use
and to make a detour around the house and face
the back entrance, and I would give him time to
get in position, and as I enter the front door he
must enter the back door, and we must get the
drop on them, otherwise they might get it on us.
I told the other fellow to follow me and do as I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
do and not to fire unless I do. I carried a couple
of colts pistols. As we entered the negro women
and the men were sitting on benches before the
fire, when I exclaimed, surrender! in the meantime
covering them with my pistols and the
guns of my comrades. They jumped as if
lightning has struck them. "Unbuckle your
weapons or you are dead men; be quick about
it." My orders were executed with alacrity and
we marched them out of the house. In the far
end of the house I spied a plow line hanging
from a nail in the wall. I appropriated the
same and we unhitched the horses and walked
to where ours were. Not a word was spoken
by either of us. The horses were brought forward
and the prisoners mounted. The plow line
served to pinion their legs under the animals below.
All this was done as quickly as possible.
When the prisoners realized that we were but
three, one of them commenced being obtrusive
and talking loud and abusive. I cautioned him
and his comrades that unless they moved along
quietly and not talk above a whisper we would
be compelled to leave them by the roadside, for
some one, unknown to us, to bury them. My
admonition had a good effect, and our cavalcade
advanced in a lope, one leading the horses, the
prisoners were riding by the bridle reins, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
I and the other man closing up the rear. I was
fearful of meeting some of their scouting parties,
of which General Beaufort advised me of
on our departure, but it seemed that they were
in some other direction from us, for we noted the
firmament in every direction lit up by an aurora
borealis from the burning houses those miscreants
set afire. When arriving close to our
pickets we halted. I sent one of my escort in
advance to announce our arrival so as not to be
fired into, as it was only day break and still too
dark to be recognized. I rode at once to General
Beaufort's headquarters to report. He was
still in bed; the guard admitted me. He said, I
thought you were on your way to Selma. I said,
General, I met with an accident and came back.
An accident said he! So I stated that accidentally
I captured three Federals and got me a
horse at my first opportunity. He got up and
dressed, had the prisoners brought before him
and commenced questioning them but they were
very reticent and evaded many of his questions.
General Beaufort was very anxious to find out
the strength of his adversary in his immediate
front and their destination. I suggested that I
change my clothing for the uniform of one of the
prisoners who was my size, and ride in their
line. He said, That is a very dangerous business;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
if you are trapped they will hang you. I
said, I am in for the war; life as it is is not
worth much, I'll take the chances. So that night
after midnight I passed again our videttes, in
company with two escorts who accompanied me
for company sake for a few miles, when they
returned to camp and I went it alone. After
passing the cottage of the old lady where we
sought information, the previous night, I put
my horse at full speed and passed the negro
quarters. No one was astir and I continued my
course for about three miles when I saw some
obstruction in the road on the brow of the hill.
Halt, was the command. I halted, at within
about seventy-five yards. Who comes. A friend.
Seeing that I was alone I was asked to advance.
As I approached I noted that there was a rail
fence across the road, behind which were two
sentinels, their muskets pointing at me. I remarked
as I crossed the fence, Didn't I have a
race; those four rebels run me clean to nearly
where I am. My horse was steaming wet. I
said, You see that fire yonder; we set the gin
house afire when the rebels came up and gave
me a hot chase. The sentinels were all excitement
and kept their eyes to the front. I had
dismounted and placed myself in line with them.
I could have killed them both but that was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
my object. Finally, seeing no one coming, I
said they must have gone back. I mounted my
steed and slowly rode up, in a walk, where I
saw what I thought was the main camp, but it
was only what was known as the grand guard of
about a half a regiment of cavalry. Taking in
the surroundings at a glance I noted the horses
hitched in the corners of the fence along the
road and the men some lying, some sitting on
improvised seats around their camp fire. I at
once rode to an empty corner in the fence and
hitched my horse and walked to a fire where
most of the men were lying down, seemingly
sleeping. There lay one empty blanket on the
ground and I laid myself down on it, facing the
fire, which felt pretty good, for I was chilled, the
night being cold. As I pretended to take a nap
some fellow gave me a hunch with his foot, saying,
Hello comrade, you are lying on my blanket.
I grunted a little and turned some further
when he pulled the blanket from under me.
This seemingly roused me, and I was wide
awake. I stretched out my arms as if I were
yawning, addressing myself to the men next to
me, "This is a terrible life to lead. Where are
we going? To Savannah. I heard some say
Savannah. That is in Georgia, a long ways
from here; I am afraid some of us will never get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
there; I heard that there is an army of fifteen
thousand rebels ahead of us within fifteen miles
of here." He answered, That would not amount
to much with what we have. I thought I would
stretch as far as I could reasonably do so, for
General Beauford's force was only 1,500 strong.
You say that would not amount to much with
what we have to oppose them? He said Wilson's
Corps amounts to nearly 25,000. O, not
that much. He commenced to enumerate different
regiments, the number of cannon, etc.,
etc. All at once I heard the bugle blast "Call to
Horse," and everything was active. What's the
matter I said, seeing everybody catching their
horses? He answered, Did you not get three
days rations? I said, Yes. Well we are going
to advance. I run to my horse and mounted. I
felt that I had to advise General Beauford of
this move, and not to pass the picket post that I
did coming in I took down the railroad track
which run parallel the wagon road some distance,
but to my surprise there was a vidette
post there of two sentinels. They halted me,
saying, You can't pass. I remarked that they
will be relieved in a few minutes, that our forces
are advancing. There being a nice spring of
water in sight, just to the left of the road I
wanted to fill my canteen full of water. The road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
being very dusty I suggested that I would fill
theirs if they wished me to in the meantime.
I'll be back in a few seconds. So they handed
me their canteens and I put the spurs to my
horse. Further on I turned to the left into the
wagon road and post haste and at full gallop
rode into our camp, which was twelve miles
ahead of me. The cap which I had borrowed
from one of our prisoners was a little too big
for my head and in my haste to reach camp blew
off. I did not stop to pick it up, but reached
camp in about three quarters of an hour. It
still being a little before day a bullet passed me
in close proximity and I knew that I was close to
our lines. I stopped and held up both hands.
The bad marksmanship of the sentinel saved
me from being shot. I at once rode up to the
General's quarters, was admitted by the sentinel
and made my report. He was still in bed,
but he got up and ordered two companies of
Col. Armistead's Regiment to the front and deployed
into a skirmish line. In less than an
hour we heard the firing. All the forces were
astir, and we withdrew towards West Point,
Georgia, thus giving the enemy the right of way.
The General asked me if I held any commission.
I said, Yes, high private in the rear ranks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Well, I'll see that you will be promoted when I
make my report to the war department. I need
a hundred men just like you.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>


<p>That evening I donned my disguise as
a citizen, and advanced, as before, to go
through their lines as an alien. I rode as
before as far as my judgment would permit
to prevent the capture of my escort, when
I took it afoot to carry out the program
first suggested. I walked about four miles and
day was breaking. As two nights previous, the
country indicated depredations by fires. When
I again, as the night before, saw obstructions in
front of me, I walked within twenty-five or
thirty paces up to it when I was commanded to
halt and challenged as to who comes there,
their muskets pointing at me. I said, "Me no
speaky English, je parle Francais." Where
are you going? Me no stand English. They
made me a sign to sit down by the side of the
obstructive fence, after having let me cross their
barricade. About fifteen minutes later an officer
with the relief guard came up. Who's that
you got there? How did he get here? They
answered I walked up. He is a foreigner and
can't speak our language. Turning to me he said,
where are you going? "Je ne comprenspas, je
parle francais." So he made me signs to following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
him, which I did. He conducted me to a
large camp fire where I saw several men guarding
others and recognized them to be Confederates.
This was the first time I felt my danger;
I was afraid that there might be some among
the prisoners that might have seen me before
and might recognize me. However my fears
were without cause as I did not know any of
them. About eight o'clock a. m., the Provost
Marshall General came around and addressed
himself to me. Who are you, said he. As before,
I said je parle francais. Oh, you are a
Frenchman. Well, I will get some one that can
speak to you. He ordered one of the guards to
go to a Canadian Company and ask the Captain
to send him a man that could speak French and
English. Presently a young soldier presented
himself. The Provost took him aside and I pretended
not to notice them. They stepped to
within a few paces of me; when I heard the Provost
say to him, Pump him. I thought, He will
be welcome to all he will get out of me. He
stepped up to me and talked to me in French.
I appeared to be so glad to meet one I could talk
to, that I did not give him an opportunity to
ask me a single question. I told him how I came
here in the fall of 1859, pulling out my passport
which he scrutinized and handed over to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
Provost, who in turn looked at the same. I told
him that I made a mistake coming here, that the
people made it very unpleasant to me because I
would not enlist; that I had to leave Georgia,
and I am now on my way to New Orleans, which
I heard the port was open so as to see the
French consul to assist me back to France; that
I am tired of this land where people murder
each other. During all of our conversation the
Provost said, What does he say. My interlocutor
explained and then they all would laugh.
Finally I said that I was hungry, that I had had
nothing to eat in 24 hours. So the Provost said,
Boys, can you fix up something for him among
you, and they all contributed some from their
rations and filled my haversack full of substantial
food, and besides contributed $10.00 in
money. I thanked them and started off, after
being told that I could go, but as I was apparently
green I asked my questioner how far I
was from New Orleans and if there were any
more places where I might be delayed, when
the Provost intervened with his, What did he
say? Which after being explained to him, he
said, I had better give him a pass, they might
take him up on the other end of the line, and so
he wrote on a slip of paper, "Pass the bearer
through the line," and signed his name in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
chirography that I could not read it. I arrived
into Montgomery late that afternoon, and reported,
as per previous arrangement with Col.
Paul to Judge Pollard, whose daughter he married,
and told that family how the boys were
getting along. Judge Pollard was a stately old
gentleman of great prominence in that section
of the country. He received me in his large library
and we had quite a long conversation
over the situation. I told him that I was directed
to him with the understanding that he would
provide me with a horse so that I might continue
my journey to Selma. He shook his head and
said I'll see what can be done, but I don't believe
there is a horse to be got within ten miles
of here; the Yankees stole every horse and mule
they could lay their hands on, and sure enough
he was unable to furnish me with an animal, but
thought I might, by making a long detour beyond
the flanks of the enemy's columns, be able
to proceed. That morning one of the ladies presented
me with a tobacco bag, made out of a
piece of pink merino, and the initials of my
name embroidered on it with yellow silk and
filled with smoking tobacco, and a shaker pipe
stuck in it. It was quite a novelty and was
highly appreciated. After having partaken of
a substantial breakfast I bid my host and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
family good bye, visited my friends Faber,
Lewellen, Coleman and other acquaintances of
the city, all of which had their tales of woe and
sufferings to account at the hands of the enemy.
I departed for Selma on foot. I was weary and
depressed. I heard that I was again in close
proximity to the enemy who routed Forrest
from that city and came within a fraction of
either killing or capturing him. He was surrounded
by four troopers who demanded his surrender,
when he threw his saber, spurred his
horse and ran the gauntlet among a shower of
bullets. I heard that in the melee he received a
saber cut in the face. I felt sick at heart and
physically worn out and took a rest and wended
my way to Col. Bowen, who was glad to see me
and offered me all the comforts to recruit my
strength. I remained there nearly a week. I
really did not know where to report to, General
Beauford being on the retreat before Wilson's
corps who came from via Pensacola, Florida.
I was surrounded on every side, so I concluded
to retrace my way back to Montgomery but when
a few miles from Greenville as I emerged from
a long lane at the end of which the road turned
into a forest I noted some Federal soldiers. I
came within a very short distance of them before
seeing them; my first impulse was to run<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
back, but I was tired, it being a warm day and
nothing to protect me from the bullets, having
an open lane where they might play at my fleeing
figure. I concluded to give up on demand,
but on close approach, seeing that they were
negro troops I regretted not having taken chances,
however great, of escape, especially when
I was asked to surrender my arms, which consisted
of a couple of colts 6 inch pistols, one of
which I carried in a scabbard buckled around
me and the other in the belt of my pants, which
were tucked in my boot legs. In unbuckling my
belt I contracted my body allowing the one in
my pants to slide down my leg into my boot and
thus only surrendered one of them. The other
I carried on as I marched. The friction of the
barrel on the ankle of my foot gave me excruciating
pains but I continued on until I could
feel the blood on the inside of my boot. There
were other prisoners, among them General Pillow
and his son, George. Arriving in Montgomery
we were locked up in the Lehman Brothers
building which had served as a shoe factory for
the Confederate Government. I intended to use
my weapon at the first opportunity I saw to gain
my liberty. That night I asked for a doctor to
dress my wounded foot. He came and asked me
how that happened. My socks adhered to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
wounds and the pains it gave me were unbearable.
I told him I had snagged myself. He
dressed my wound and I felt relieved to a great
extent. The next morning I sent word to my
friend Faber to come to see me and he did so. I
said to him to see if he could not get me a parole,
after he had told me that he had had some Yankee
officers quartered at his house, saying that
they were all Western men and seemed to be
clever fellows. He promised to use his influence.
Presently he returned with an officer and I was
turned out on parole, but to report every morning
at nine o'clock. The following morning I
reported, when the officer commanded one of the
men to take charge of me and lock me up. I
thought the jig was up, that probably I had been
reported by some one and that I might fare the
worst for it. There were fifty prisoners; we
were all called out to form into line and from
that into column, and marched up the hill to the
capitol, where we received some salt pork and
hard tack to last us three days. We were informed
that we would be sent to Ship Island, a
country of yellow fever, close to New Orleans in
retaliation of Andersonville, there to take the
chances to live or die; undoubtedly they would
have preferred the latter. About one o'clock p. m.
a courier rode up to the capitol, followed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
another. Presently we were informed that the
war was over, that General Lee had surrendered
and that Lincoln was assassinated and instead
of being sent to Ship Island we were to be paroled
under promise not to take up arms again
against the United States, until properly exchanged.
This brings us up to the early part
of June 1865, or latter part of May.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>


<p>Thus it will be noted that while the war was
over in the East, we of the Western army didn't
know it and were still fighting, all communication
between the two armies being cut off. My
friend Faber, who was one of the most popular
citizens of Montgomery was afterwards elected
Mayor of the City. The following morning I
prepared to wend my way back to Georgia. My
foot was inflamed and gave me pain, so I said to
a Yankee Sergeant who was in waiting on some
of the officers there if he could not manage to
get me some piece of a horse to ride as I was a
long ways from home and in a crippled condition.
He said, Yes, if I would give him my
watch, which was an open faced, old fashioned
English lever, generally called bulls-eye. I acquiesced.
We marched down one of the main
thoroughfares. We halted before an establishment
which was used as a guard house and previously
had served as a store. In its front on
the sidewalk was a cellar. The Sergeant asked
them to bring out that horse, and in the meantime
asked me for the watch. Thinking of him
as a clever, sympathetic soul, owing to his
prompt offer of assistance, I unhesitatingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
handed him my watch. They having entered the
cellar, they lifted out of its confines a frame of
horse so poor that six men took him bodily and
placed him on the sidewalk. He was actually
nothing but skin and bones; I was astonished
that life could have existed in such a frame. I
said, Is this the best you can do for me? He
said, I promised you a horse for your watch and
here he is, and he left me. The men were amused
at my discomfiture. I finally concluded that a
bad ride is better than a good walk and I made
the best of a bad bargain. I asked the men if
they could get me a bridle and saddle. They answered
that they had none, so I made me a halter
out of the rope around his neck, pulled off
my coat as padding on either side of his sharp
backbone so as to serve me as a saddle and asked
the man next to me to give me a lift, and there
I was, mounted, representing the picture of Don
Quixote to perfection. I urged the horse forward
and the men hollered Whoa! which command
he was only too eager to obey, I eventually
got away from that place and took the Eufaula
route homeward. It was four o'clock in the
afternoon and I was only four miles from my
starting point. The animal had neither eat nor
drunk anything while in my possession and from
his looks probably not in several days previous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
I saw as I passed along at a snail gait, a corral
by the side of the road, with all kinds of contraband.
There were negroes, women and children,
cattle of all description and a quantity of
mules and horses, all encircled by a large rope
and guarded by sentinels. I passed a soldier
about a half mile from this place. I said to him,
What troops are those on the right hand side up
the hill? He said they were cavalry. I concluded
to ride up, that probably I might induce
the officer to exchange animals with me so as to
enable me to get along, for I came to the conclusion
to abandon my steed and take a bad walk
in preference to a bad ride. As I approached
the camp I noticed a man sitting on a camp stool,
his back towards me, his feet propped up
against a large tree, reading a newspaper and
seemingly greatly preoccupied as he did not
hear my approach. He was in negligee, it being
a very warm day; he wore nothing but his pants
and a spotted white blouse shirt and was bareheaded.
I left my horse by the side of a stump
and slid off, approaching within a respectful
distance in his rear, I said, Good evening. He
jumped like he had been shot. I said excuse me
sir, I did not mean to scare you. So he peremptorily
said, What will you have? I answered,
Are you the commander of these troops? He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
said, Yes; what will you have? I answered that
I was a paroled prisoner on my way home; that
I was crippled and had a long ways to go. The
horse I got I bought from one of the Federals
for a silver watch. It took me a whole day to
get from the City to where I am; that I had
noted, coming along, a corral with many loose
horses and mules and I ventured to see if he
would not be kind enough to furnish me with a
better mount than the one I possessed. He replied,
What country are you from? I am from
France. How long have you been in the army?
Ever since the war started. Were you forced
into the army or did you volunteer? I volunteered
sir. And you have been fighting us for
over four years and now come and ask me for a
favor? You need not grant it; good bye. And
off I hobbled to where I left my horse taking
him by the mane I led him up to the stump and
was about to mount when the officer commanded
me, Come back here, said he, I like your style.
You are the first one I've met but what was
forced into the army. Tell the officer in charge
of the corral to exchange animals with you. I
remarked, Colonel, a written order from you
might have a better effect. He laughed, got up
and walked into his tent and when he returned
he handed me a slip of paper addressed to Capt.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
Ledger, and read as follows: Exchange animals
with the bearer; Col. York, Com'd'g 7,
Indiana Cavalry. I thanked him, gave the military
salute and retraced my steps towards the
corral. I presented my note to the Capt. in
charge; he said, Pick out the one you want.
There were some excellent animals but many
were galled and not serviceable for any immediate
use. I spied a medium sized, plump mule.
She was in excellent order, and as I was short
in funds I thought I could tether her out to eat
grass and thus progress without having to buy
food. So I took the mule. I asked him if he
would furnish me with a saddle and bridle, and
he let me have nearly a new Mexican saddle and
bridle and I was once more in good shape. Capt.
Ledger asked me where I was going. I said,
Home, in Georgia. Which way? I am on my
way to Eufaula. So he said, I believe I'll ride a
piece of the way with you. He had his horse
caught, which was a magnificent animal. Riding
along side by side I remarked, Captain that is
a splendid horse you are on. He said, Yes, I
have a pair, you could not tell one from the
other; they are spirited animals but perfectly
gentle. Their owner must have prized them
highly; some of the men picked them up. That's
a new name for stealing, said I. He remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
I suppose so, but if I could find out their owner
I am going to return them to him; I am making
some effort towards it. I said, Well sir, it does
me good to hear you say so, and to know that
there are some men of feeling, and gentlemen
among your army. He said, Well, war is war.
It is true that many acts were committed unnecessarily
harsh, but I am glad it is over and I
hope we will all be friends again. He stopped,
saying, Well, I have ridden far enough, and I
am going back. We shook hands, he wished me
a safe journey and cantered back to his camp.
It was already late and I proceeded as far as
Fort Browder and stopped over night with Mr.
Tom Wells. His wife was also a Georgian and
a kinswoman of the Braswell family.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>


<p>The following morning after bidding my
host good bye I took the road to Union Springs.
On my way I caught up with General Pillow,
who was riding in a carriage drawn by two fine
mules, and his son George, who was riding
horseback. I said, Hello! On your way home?
He answered, Yes. What route are you going?
We are trying to make Union Springs for tonight;
father is not very well and we are making
short stations. I remarked, I am surprised
they left you your horse. He said, They left us
our side arms and let father have his carriage
and mules and me my horse. I rode up to the
carriage, shook hands with the old General,
whose head was as white as snow, congratulated
him on his good luck of being able to keep
his outfit. He said, Yes, it was more than I expected.
We traveled together for several miles
when we were met by five men, one of which, a
rather portly fellow, remarked, Boys, if this is
not Sal, I'll be hanged. And he advanced and
took my mule by the bridle, saying, This mule
belongs to me, you will have to get off. I said, I
reckon not, drawing my pistol. He said, The
Yankees stole that mule from me. I said, Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
I got her from the Yankees, but she cost me a
watch worth about thirty dollars. I stated facts
as they were, saying, I am on my way to Eufaula
and I am crippled and can't walk, and I
shall ride there if it costs me my life. So General
Pillow interfered, saying, Gentlemen, this
is a Confederate soldier on his way home; he is
crippled and can't walk. I will pay you for the
mule to end the matter. What kind of money?
Confederate, of course, I have no other. Well,
that is not worth a curse. That is all I've got.
The men were still standing in front of me and
occasionally touched the reins, when I cocked
my pistol, saying, Turn that bridle loose, I am
going to Eufaula on this mule. After that I do
not care what becomes of it; I expect to take the
boat there for Columbus. He answered, I tell
you what I'll do; here is a gold chain; I suppose
it is worth as much as your watch. I will give
you that chain and you'll leave the mule with the
hotel man and I'll get her there. So I said all
right, when General Pillow remarked, Gentlemen,
undoubtedly you are in search of stock;
suppose you were to find any that belongs to
somebody else, which it would be pretty apt to
be, and the owner would come and claim it;
would you turn it over to him? The spokesman
hesitated, then said, I don't know if I would or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
not. I said, well, our arrangement suits me;
what is the hotel keeper's name? He told me
but I have forgotten it. So we arrived at our
destination about one hour by sun and stopped
all night at the house of Major Pemberton, a
friend of General Pillow's. George and I occupied
the same bed. He proved to be an excellent
companion and we recounted many incidents
to one another. After breakfast we
parted company. I took the route to Eufaula,
Ala., by myself, leaving General Pillow and his
son with our host, with whom they proposed to
stay for a few days, before continuing their
homeward journey, which was near Franklin,
Tenn. I arrived at Eufaula at about three
o'clock p. m. and inquired for the hotel, whose
proprietor I found sitting in a chair in front.
Is this the hotel? Yes sir. A soldier on his way
home? Yes sir. This is a good mule you have
got; will you sell her? I said, How much will
you give me for it? He remarked, I have only
Thirty-Five Dollars, in Mexican silver and some
Confederate money that nobody takes about
here. I'll give you the Mexican dollars for the
outfit. You will also give me my dinner and fill
my haversack with provisions to last me home?
Yes, I'll do that too. What time will the boat
leave for Columbus? At four o'clock. Well, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
have time to take dinner. I turned the mule
over to him, he had me served something to eat
and paid me thirty-five Mexican silver dollars.
I took the chain, which was not gold but galvanized
brass, and said, I am glad I have made
connection with the boat, I will get home sooner.
Handing the proprietor the chain, I said, There
is a gentleman who may call for me; you tell
him I made connection and went on. This chain
belongs to him and I want him to have it. All
right, said he. The boat, according to schedule,
left for Columbus with me aboard. In Columbus
I met Dr. Mullin, a friend of Dr. Crawford's,
but could get no information as to his whereabouts.
From Columbus I traveled to Atlanta.
The sight that met my view was sickening. Instead
of a nice little city, for it must be remembered
that Atlanta at that time was not the cosmopolitan
of this day, it could not have had
over seven or eight thousand inhabitants; there
it lay in ashes, the work of vandalism. The
brick chimneys marked the places where comfortable
shelters used to stand. Its inhabitants
fled from the approaching foe, fearing even a
worse fate at the hands of such unscrupulous
barbarians. From Atlanta I followed in the
wake of Sherman's army towards Macon, and
had it not been for my trade with the hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
keeper of Eufaula to have my haversack filled,
I could not have existed to the end of my journey.
As already stated, the Country for miles
in every direction was sacked and burned. I
say this much for the New England civilization,
of these days, that in no country, civilized or uncivilized,
could such barbarism have excelled
such diabolical manifestation. I arrived in
Macon at dusk, intending to pass the night at
my cousin's. In front of the Brown House
came an ambulance, said to contain President
Jefferson Davis. They traveled at a good trot,
surrounded by a body of cavalry which I was informed
were Wilson's men, Macon being in the
hands of that General to whom General Howell
Cobb surrendered that city. I was sick at heart
at our entire helplessness and complete prostration.
I called on my relatives who were glad to
see me again among the living. They were much
depressed at the condition of things, hoping for
the best, but expecting the worst. I met Mr.
Kaufman, General Cobb's orderly, as I was
about to leave for what I called home. I stated
that if there was a chance for me to get something
to ride it would greatly facilitate my locomotion.
My ankle, although still sore was healing
nicely. Mr. Kaufman said, I will sell you
my horse, I have got nothing to feed him on. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
said, I will give you all the money I got for the
mule, having given them already the history of
my itinerary from Montgomery to Macon. He
accepted my offer and I was again in a traveling
condition. All along my route devastation met
my view. I could not find sufficient corn to give
my horse a square meal. Wherever I found a
green spot I dismounted to let my horse eat
grass. I traveled at night as well as in the day
time and arrived at my destination about 10
o'clock a. m. the next day.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>


<p>Conditions there were not as bad as I
had seen along the line of march, although
they were bad enough. Mr. and Mrs. Braswell
received me as if I had been one of
their own family. I found the premises badly
dilapidated, fences down everywhere and everything
in disorder, the negro men gone, following
the yankee army, the negro women and children
were still left to be taken care of by their Master
and Mistress. Before leaving the Yankees
started to set the premises on fire but the servant
intervened and begged for their good master
and mistress and they desisted in their intentions.
I asked if old Sallie could wash my
clothes I had on, and if I could borrow something
to put on while mine was in process of
cleaning, for the enemy had stolen my trunk and
its contents and I had no change of garments.
Mr. Braswell was of very corpulent stature,
fully six feet high, weighing about 250 pounds,
while I, in my emaciated condition only weighed
135. One of his garments would have wrapped
twice around me. At 12 o'clock dinner was announced,
and I was surprised at the good and
substantial meal that was served. The menu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
consisted of fried ham and eggs, corn bread, biscuits,
butter and honey. I said, "folks, you
ought not to complain; if you had gone through
where I have and seen what I have seen you
would feel like you live like royalty, for I have
seen women and children scratch in the ground
for a few grains of corn for sustenance where
the enemy's horses were camped and fed." Mr.
Braswell then explained how he managed when
he heard of the enemy's approach. He took his
cattle, horses and mules and everything he
could move, deep in the Ogeechee swamp, leaving
only a few broke down around his premises
which the enemy, General Kilpatrick's cavalry,
shot down and left for the buzzards. Mrs. Braswell
asked me what I was going to do. I said I
did not know; I was in hope to meet Cousin Abe
Hermann, but you say he was taken prisoner.
Do you know where they carried him to? They
answered, No, that Cousin Abe was drafted and
went, as a sutler in General Rube Carswell's
regiment and was captured by the enemy and
that they had heard nothing from him, direct.
Then Mr. Braswell said, As long as I've got a
mouthful I will divide with you. We are poor
and I don't know how to begin with the new order
of things, all the hands having left me.
After telling Mrs. Braswell about her kindred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
in Alabama and of my ups and downs during
that afternoon, I spent a sleepless night, ruminating
in my mind as to what to do. The future
looked dark, the country was ruined. Wherever
I cast my eyes, conditions looked the same. The
following morning after breakfast I approached
Mr. Braswell, saying, My friend, I can't accept
your proposition to be an extra burden to you in
your already impoverished condition. He said,
What are you going to do? I said, The next
time you hear from me I will be in a position to
make a support, or I will be a dead cock in the
pit. I am going to leave this morning. I left
for Sandersville, where I met many friends.
While there I heard of some of the boys having
picked up an abandoned Confederate wagon.
There were about fifteen that claimed a share in
it. The next day I went to Milledgeville and
stopped this side at Mr. Stroters, who had run a
distillery during the war. I said, Mr. Stroter
have you any whiskey on hand? He said, Yes,
one barrel, I had it buried. Can I get about five
gallons? He said, Yes. What will you take for
it? Five dollars a gallon, in Yankee money, the
Confederate money is no good now. I said, I'll
take five gallons if you have a keg to put it in. I
have no money of the description you want,
but I will leave you my horse in bond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the morning I proceeded on my way
to Macon, carrying the five gallon keg of whiskey
on my shoulder. The journey was a long
one, thirty-two miles, with a burden and it
being summer time was no small undertaking.
I arrived however, in East Macon the following
day. I entered the woods in search of a clay
root where I could hide away my burden. I
found a large tree that was blown down, leaving
a big hole, where I placed my keg and covered it
with leaves. I marked the place so as to find it
when wanted. I also carried a canteen full of
liquor under my coat, and walked towards Macon.
On the way I met a Federal in deep study. I
passed him a step or two, then stopped and said,
Say! He turned, saying, you speak to me? I
said, Yes, would you like to have a drink? He
said, Yes, the best in the world. I tell you how
you can get this canteen full. If you bring me
out a mule this side the sentinel I will give you
this canteen full. He remarked, You'll wait
yonder until I return. I waited over an hour,
when I saw him come on a small mule. The exchange
was quickly effected, and I rode back to
Milledgeville and left the mule at Stroters. After
eating a hearty meal I returned on foot to
Macon, I repeated the same tactics, brought
back three mules and sold over one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
drinks at $1.00 a drink, paid Stroter my debt
and returned to Washington County, left my
stock with my friend B. S. Jordan to tend his
crop, who at that time had a negro plowing an
old steer. I said, Ben, Work your crop, for I
do not know how long you can keep them. I returned
to Sandersville in quest of the boys who
claimed the captured Confederate wagon, and
to purchase it. They agreed if I would bring
each a wool hat from Savannah on my return I
could have the wagon, which I agreed to. Major
Irwin gave me an old set of gears and I was
ready to carry freight from Sandersville and
Washington County to Savannah for a living,
for let it be known that Sherman in his vandalism
tore up the Central railroad all the way
from Macon to Savannah, Ga., and for eight
months after the surrender I continued wagoning
hauling freight back and forth, taking the
weather as it came, rain or shine, cold or warm.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>


<p>My first journey as wagoner to Savannah was a
successful one. There was still some cotton
through the country that escaped the Sherman
depredators. Mr. W. G. Brown let me have two
bales. Mr. Pinkus Happ let me have one. My
tariff was $5.00 per 100 pounds, and the same
returning. I took the Davisboro road from Sandersville,
having only two mules hitched to the
wagon. I had sent word to Mr. Jordan to meet
me with my horse and mule still in his possession.
The road was heavy for it was a rainy
season and to make it lighter pulling I concluded
to have a four mule team. So we put the
harness on the horse and mule and hitched them
in the lead. About that time a negro I knew,
named Perry, came up and made himself useful.
I said, Perry, what are you doing? Nothing,
Marse Ike. How would you like to wagon for me
at $15.00 a month and rations? Very well, said
he. Well, jump in the saddle, I am on my way
to Savannah. It was about four o'clock p. m.
Perry took hold of the line and cracked his whip,
when the horse, whose other qualities, except a
saddle horse I did not know, commenced to kick
in a spirited manner, so as to skin his legs with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
the trace chains in which he became entangled, I
had to unhitch him. Mr. John Salter was present
and saw the whole proceeding. I remarked,
Well. I am sorry for that for I had expected to
have a four horse team, and now can have only
a spike team. Salter said, Hermann, what will
you take for this horse? You say he is a good
saddle horse? I never straddled a better one.
What will you give me? He said he had no
money but had two bales of cotton under his gin
house and I could have it for the horse. How
far do you live from here? Two miles only.
All right, the horse is yours. Perry, let us go and
get the cotton. Mr. Salter led the way where
the cotton was. We loaded the same and drove
that night to the Fleming place and camped.
The trip was uneventful. We made the journey
to Savannah in four days. There was a firm of
cotton factors named Bothwell and Whitehead
doing business in the City, and they were my objective
point. However, before arriving into
the city, about thirty miles this side, I met men
wanting to buy my cotton. They offered me
from fifteen to fifty cents per pound. I did not
know what the value was; I knew that before the
war started it brought about eight cents. However,
I drove up to the firms office on Bay street.
I saw Mr. Bothwell; after the usual greeting I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
said, What is cotton selling at? It brought
.62&frac12; this a. m., but I think I can get more than
that if it is good cotton. To make matters short
I got .65 per pound and the two bales Salter let
me have for my horse weighed 600 pounds a
bale, netting me $720.00. I bought me another
mule and now I was again fully equipped and
made the voyage regularly every week. I took a
partner, as the business was more than I could
attend to by myself; his name was Solomon
Witz. He would engage freight during my absence,
and we sometimes made the trip together.
The country was forever in a state of excitement.
New edicts appeared from time to time
from Washington, D. C., Congress promulgated
laws to suit their motives, and notwithstanding
the agreement between General Lee and General
Grant at Appomattox that the men should return,
build up their waste places and not again
to take up arms until properly exchanged and
they should not be molested as long as they
should attend to their daily avocations, Congress
established what was then known as the
Freedmen's Bureau, seemingly for the protection
of the negroes, as if they needed any, as
their devotion to their master and their behavior
at home while every white man able to bear
arms was at the front fighting for their homes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and firesides, leaving their families in the hands
of their slaves whose devotion was exemplary,
was not that a sufficient guarantee of the relationship
between slaves and masters? The attachment
was of the tenderest kind and a white
man would have freely offered his life for the
protection of his servants; but that condition did
not suit our adversaries. Although we thought
the war was over, it was not over and more terrible
things awaited the Southern people. Emissaries
of every description, like vultures, surnamed
carpet baggers, for all they possessed
could be enclosed into a hand bag, overran this
country to fatten on the remnants left. School
mams of the far East, of very questionable reputation,
opened what were called schools, presumably
to teach the negroes how to read and
write, but rather to inculcate into their minds
all sorts of deviltry, embittering their feelings
against their former owners and life long
friends, urging them to migrate for unless they
did they would still be considered as bondsmen
and bondswomen, thus breaking up the kind relation
existing between the white man and the
negro. And all this under the protection of the
Freedmen's Bureau backed up by a garrison of
Federals stationed in every town and city
throughout the Southern States. In fact the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
South was made to feel the heels of the despots.
Military Governors were appointed. All those
who bore arms or aided or abetted in the cause
of the South were disfranchised, the negro was
enfranchised and allowed the ballot, with a military
despot at the helm and negroes and carpet
baggers, and a few renegades such as can be
found in any country, as legislators. The ship
of state soon run into shallow waters and was
pounded to pieces on the reeves of bankruptcy.
Taxes were such that property owners could not
meet them and they had the misfortune to see
their lifelong earnings sacrificed under so called
legal process, of the hammer, for a mere
song. These were the actual conditions in the
days of the so called reconstruction. Bottom
rail on top, was the slogan of those savage
hordes. Forty acres and a mule, and to every
freedman, Government rations, was the prelude
of legislation. Men who took up arms in defense
of their sacred rights could not be expected to
endure such a state of affairs forever, the
women and children must be protected. The
garrisons were gradually withdrawn; the carpet
baggers remained and ruled; negroes
formed themselves into clubs and organizations
under their leadership, when as an avalanche all
over the Southern states appeared the K. K.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
K.'s, called the Ku Klux Klan, or the Boys Who
Had Died at Manassas, who have come back to
regulate matters. Terror struck into the ranks
of the guilty and of the would be organizers and
the country soon resumed its normal state,
Governors fled and Legislators took to the bush.
But I am deviating from my subject.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>


<p>On the following trip to Savannah I met G.
W. Kelley and Dr. G. L. Mason, on the same
errand, viz. hauling cotton to market. After
having disposed of the same we reloaded our
teams in merchandise, which was easily disposed
of, as the country was in need of everything
that could add to the comfort or even necessities
of the people. The country being in
the condition it was, we were glad to travel together
for company's sake. So in the evening
we left and camped about twelve miles out of
the city. As a rule one of the party ought to
have been on guard, but such was not the case
that night. About midnight I awoke and found
two of my mules gone. I noted also that the
line with which they were attached had been cut
with a sharp knife. Following the tracks they
led back into the city. So I left my partner at
Savannah on the lookout while I went my way
back to Sandersville, minus two mules. I managed
to buy two more mules to fill out my team.
I had to take what was offered to me, at any
price, my partner, after remaining several days
at Savannah, recognized one of the mules in
charge of a negro. He called for the police and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
had the negro arrested. There being no legal
judge, the case was carried before a captain of
one of the military companies stationed there.
The negro proved by a confederate that this
mule was in his possession long before my partner
claimed it was stolen, thus setting up an
alibi, without proving as to where he got her
from. My partner failed to get the mule and
had to pay about $8.00 costs for his trouble,
which was all the cash he had with him. Later
the firm received a bill for $5.00 more cost but I
paid no attention to it and never heard of it any
more.</p>

<p>Under the advice of their instructors, the
blacks were going and coming. The road to
Savannah was traveled by them at night as well
as by day. Most of them were making for the
cities. Savannah was the goal for those in this
section. One evening on my way I stopped my
team within eighteen miles this side of the City.
Mr. Guerry, who was a fairly well to do farmer
for those days and conditions, near to whose
domicile I camped, buying some corn and fodder
from him to feed my team, also such provisions
for myself as he had for sale. At break
of day we had left on our weary journey; on my
return a day or so afterwards I passed his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
premises and to keep from walking I had bought
me an extra mule. As I rode up I noticed Mr.
Guerry and three of his sons in a pen, ready to
kill hogs. It was on a Friday, in the month of
December, 1865. It was a clear, beautiful, cold
day. I greeted them, Good morning, gentlemen,
this is a beautiful day to kill hogs. Without
noticing my greeting, one of them said, "This is
the fellow," when the old fellow picked up his
gun from the fence corner and raising the same
exclaimed, "You are the d&mdash;&mdash;d fellow that took
off our cook." I was completely taken by surprise,
and the first word I spoke I said, "You
lie", and I jumped off my mule and drew my
pistol. My neighbors say they saw her follow
your wagon the day after you camped here the
night before. I said, In fact we caught up with
a negro woman about two miles from here carrying
a large bundle on her head, and she asked
my driver if she could put her incumbrance on
the wagon. I said, No, my mules have all they
can pull, and are jaded already. In fact that
was all the words that passed between her and
me and up to about 10 o'clock a. m. she was
either walking in front or behind the team, carrying
her luggage. I did not know where she
came from nor where she was going. I supposed
she was on her way to Savannah, like the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
rest of them. I guess you see them pass here
daily. He said, some of my neighbors told me
they saw her behind your wagon. Just at that
moment Messrs. L. D. Newsome and Seaborn
Newsome and Alex Brown drove up, hauling
cotton to Savannah. I was glad to see them.
Hello boys, you of Washington County come in
good time. Here are some fellows accusing me
of stealing their negro cook. They said at once,
Oh, no! You got hold of the wrong fellow. We
know him, he comes from our county and would
not do such a thing. He is a Confederate soldier
and fought all through the war. Then I said,
Mr. Guerry, let us reason together. You have
always treated me clever when I passed here.
I have never entered your yard. I always paid
you for what you sold to me. The negroes are
free and they are thought to migrate. I had no
rights to stop the woman on her journey, but
had I known that she was your servant I would
have talked to her and advised her to go back
where she belongs. Mr. Guerry seemed to regret
his hasty words and begged my pardon,
and insisted on all of us, to go into the house for
refreshments. We finally shook hands and
parted good friends.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV.</h2>


<p>A rainy season soon set in; the streams were
overflowing, and the road became bad and hard,
to travel. On arriving at the Ogeechee river at
Summertown I found that it had deborted its
banks and was at least a quarter of a mile wide.
I struck camp, waiting for the water to recede.
The following day Geo. W. Kelley drove in
sight. He also had a load of five bales of cotton
and he struck camp. But it continued to rain
and the river instead of receding became wider
and deeper. The cotton market was declining
rapidly and we were anxious to reach the market.
I suggested to Mr. Kelley that I would
take the tallest of the mules and sound the width
of the current. The mule walked in the water
up to the banks, neck deep, when he began to
swim, I guided him when again he struck foothold.
I rode to the end of the water, in parts
only breast deep. I retraced my steps and reported
my investigation. We held counsel together
and concluded that by using prolongs we
could hitch the eight mules to one wagon and
while the rear mules would be in mid stream the
front ones would be on terra firma and pull the
team across. We sent to Mr. Coleman who lived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
close by, for ropes. We cut saplings, laid them
on top of each wagon, fastened the ends tight
to the wagon body so as to prevent the
current from washing off any of the cotton
while the wagon would be submerged in midstream
during the crossing. Our plan proved
to be a successful one, and thus we forded the
Ogeechee river without the least accident. We
repeated the same tactics for the remaining
wagon. We reached Savannah in due time, sold
the cotton and bought merchandise for other
parties, and I received pay going and coming.
On returning I concluded to cross the river by
the upper route, at Jenkins Ferry, to avoid recrossing
the river as per previous method. We
struck camp at dark close to the river bank. I
told Perry to feed and water the team while I
would examine the ferry flat. Presently Mr.
Stetson from Milledgeville, drove up and also
struck camp. I considered the flat a very shabby
and a dangerous affair to cross on with a heavy
load and so reported, but Mr. Stetson thought it
all right. The following morning at break of
day the ferryman was on hand as per arrangements
that evening. Stetson and his men hurried
up so as to get across first and thus gain
time. My man Perry also hurried faster than
was his wont to do, for he was usually slow in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
his movements, when I cautioned him to take
his time and go slow and let the other wagon
cross first. It was well that I did so, for the
flat went down nearly midstream, and if the
front mules had not had foot hold in time the
whole business would have drowned. Stetson's
damage in merchandise was considerable. He
was loaded with salt, cutlery and general merchandise.
When I saw that no personal damage
was done I bid them good bye to take another
route by a twenty mile detour, via. Louisville,
and crossed the river at Fenn's Bridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI.</h2>


<p>The Central road was being rebuilt from Savannah
and we met the trains at its terminals,
thus shortening the distance of our journeys.
The train had reached Guyton, thirty miles this
side of Savannah and was advancing daily until
completed to Macon. It was early in the spring
when I met the train at station No. 6, a flat country.
It had rained nearly daily for a week; the
roads were slushy, I had on a heavy load; we
had traveled the whole day long until dark. It
was hard to find a dry knob to camp on, until finally
we came to a little elevation. I said Perry
we are going to stop here. He guided the team
into the woods a few paces and unhitched, while
I was looking for a few lightwood knots to build
up a fire. Everything was wet and it was hard
to kindle up a blaze. When suddenly there arrived
on the scene an ambulance pulled by a
team of four splendid mules and thirteen Federal
soldiers alighted. They took the grounds
on the opposite side of the road. I thought to
myself, Now I am into it. Perry was on his
knees, fanning up the damp pine straw, when
one of those fellows called, Heigho, you black
fellow, come here. I said to Perry in an undertone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
Attend to your business. When the same
fellow called again, Hello you negro, I told you
to come here, did you hear me? accompanying
his remarks with the coarsest words. Perry answered,
My boss told me to tend to my business.
D&mdash;&mdash;n you and your boss, too, was his reply.
As he had completed the sentence, I being close
by the side of my wagon, reached up and took
my Spencer in hand, bringing it from a trail to
a support. I stepped to the center of the road,
saying, D&mdash;&mdash;n you some too. This is not the
first time I have met some of you at odds, and I
am ready for the fray, if it has to be. Everything
was quiet, not a word was uttered. I still
remained standing in the road, watching any
move they might make, when one of them spoke,
saying, Will you let me come to you? He spoke
in a very conciliatory tone. I said, Yes, one
at a time. He came to me unarmed, and said,
Let us have no trouble; don't pay any attention
to that fellow, he is drinking. There is plenty
of room here for all of us, without any friction.
I said, Well, if your friend is drunk, take care
of him. I am able to take care of myself. He
returned to his camp and I to mine. I heard
him say to his comrades, That fellow won't do
to fool with. By that time Perry had succeeded
in having a rousing fire and we went to work on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
the culinary department. Our meals were simple,
a little fried meat and corn bread and water
from out of a ditch. Presently one of the Federals
hollered over, "Say, Johnnie, don't you
want some coffee?" I answered, "No, it has
been so long since I tasted any I have forgotten
how it tastes." He said, We have a plenty and
you are welcome to it if you will have it. I said
I have no way to make coffee if I had any. So
one of them came over with some parched coffee
and offered it to me. I declined it, for I had no
mill to grind it, nor any vessel to stew it in.
They insisted, bringing over all of the paraphernalia
for the brewing of coffee and I must admit
that it was enjoyed by Perry, as well as myself,
it being the first that had passed my lips in four
years. After our meal was completed they came
over, one after another and sat around the fire.
The conversation became general and I found
them to be very congenial company. One brought
me a whole haversack full of green coffee, saying,
Have it, we have a sack of over a hundred
pounds. I thanked them saying, This is quite a
treat. And what seemed to be a disagreeable
affair in its incipiency terminated most agreeably.
It having become late I suggested that we
take a night cap and retire. I passed around
the jug and each returned to his respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
quarters. However I slept, as the saying is,
with one eye open. Early in the morning we
fed the mules, rekindled the fire, drank a warm
cup of coffee and ate a bite or so. We harnessed
two of our mules, two of which in the lead were
of small size, when one of the Federals proposed
to swap mules. I said, Your mules are worth
a great deal more than mine, and I have no
money to pay boot. We don't want any money
said another, we want you to have the best team
on the road, by swapping your two lead mules
for those tall black ones of ours you will have
a real fine team. They then said they were on
their way to Augusta to report to the quartermaster
there, that they had receipted for four
mules and a sack of coffee to be delivered to the
quartermaster in Augusta. The mules in their
possession were not branded as government
mules but were picked up and a mule is a mule,
so we deliver the number of heads is all that is
required. To tell the truth I feared a trap, but
while I was talking with one of them the others
changed the lead mules for two of theirs and off
they drove in a lope, singing, Old John Brown
Lies Buried in the Ground, etc. We trudged
along, Perry and I elated over our good luck,
when Perry said, Well Marse Ike, your standing
up to them made them your friends.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h2>


<p>I had rented the store house from Mr. Billy
Smith where he and Slade had done business before
the war, in Sandersville, and opened up
business in heavy and family groceries. In the
meantime my team was making the trip between
Sandersville and the Central terminal,
which had not considerably advanced, owing to
the demoralized condition of labor. So I concluded
at this particular time it would accelerate
matters by hauling a load of merchandise with
my team; hence I drove through all the way to
Savannah. While there, on passing Congress
street, I met an old friend named Abe Einstein,
of the firm of Einstein and Erkman, wholesale
drygoods merchants. He was speaking to one
Mr. Cohen from New York, who had just arrived
by steamer with a cargo of drygoods. He
wanted to locate in Augusta, but owing to the
Federals having torn up that branch of the railroad
at Millen the Augusta trains run no further
than Waynesboro. Hence he was trying to
fill in the gap with teams. Mr. Einstein told
him that I had a splendid team and that I would
be a good man for him to employ. So he asked
me if I would haul a load for him. I replied I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
would if he would pay me enough for it. He
said, How much can you pull at a load? I said,
My mules can pull all that the wagon can hold
up. What do you ask? Four hundred dollars.
Whiz, I did not want to buy your team, I only
wanted to hire it. I said to him, Well, that is my
price. I said, You fellows up North tore up the
road, you ought to be able to pay for such accommodations
as you can get. He studied over the
situation a little. Turning to Mr. Einstein, Do
you know this man; can I rely on him? Mr. Einstein
replied, Perfectly reliable, I stand sponsor.
He said, I tell you what I'll do, I'll pay
you down $200.00 and Mr. Einstein will pay you
$200.00 when you return. Mr. Einstein agreed
to it, so I said, That is satisfactory, I shall deliver
so many boxes as you put on to the agent,
take his receipt for the same and Mr. Einstein
will pay me $200.00 due. I had, to my regret,
had to discharge my teamster Perry, owing to
the neglect of duty, and engaged another named
Bill Flagg. He was an old conscientious negro,
very religiously inclined. We loaded our team
and followed instructions. On arrival at
Waynesboro, I never had been there before, so I
inquired for the depot and found an improvised
little house beside the railroad track and a man
claiming to be the railroad agent. I have a load<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
of goods here for Augusta. Put them in the car,
said he. I said, count the boxes and make me
out a receipt. He said all right. After my business
with the agent was concluded, I asked him
to show me the Louisville route, which he
pointed out to me, with several explanations as
to the right and left intervening roads. Waynesboro
was at that time, as it is now, the county
site of Burke county, a town of about 1000 inhabitants.
It has greatly improved since and is
quite a prosperous city of some importance now.</p>

<p>Before we got out of the incorporation a detachment
of Federal troops surrounded my
team and ordered my driver to dismount. I was
a few paces behind my wagon and I hurried to
the front. One of the soldiers had hold of my
mules' bridle and ordered my driver to dismount.
I said to my man, If you dismount I will
kill you; you sit where you are, you are under
my orders. I ordered the trooper to let go my
mule. He turned loose the bridle, but held his
position with others in front of the team. The
commotion brought together the balance of the
garrison and some citizens. I remarked right
here, I'll sell out; you shall not deprive me of
the means to make an honest living. So the
Captain remarked, We are ordered to take up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
all Confederate property. I said, I have no objection
for you to take up Confederate property,
but this is my individual property and your action
is highway robbery, which I do not propose
to submit to. There is a way to prove those
things; I am a citizen of Sandersville and have
been wagoning for a living. There is a garrison
of troops in my town and if this is Confederate
property they have had a chance to confiscate it
long ago. He said, What is your name? I answered,
I. Hermann, Sandersville, Washington
County, is my home. He pretended to make a
note of it and told me to drive on. I was glad to
have gotten out of that scrape. On reaching
home Flagg came to me, saying, Boss, I have to
quit you. What is the matter, Bill? said I, have
I not always treated you right. Oh yes, but I am
afraid of you. How so Bill? I am afraid some
day you might get mad with me and kill me:
Any man that can stand before a whole company
of Yankees like you and keep them from taking
his team, is a dangerous man. You must get
you another man. I said, all right, Bill. When
Perry heard that Bill Flagg had left my employment
he came to me, asking to be re-instated
and promising to be more attentive to his duties.
So I took him back and he remained with me
for several years.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII.</h2>


<p>The railroad track had advanced considerably,
and in the Fall of the year, 1866, had
reached Bartow, No. 11. My partner for some
time had taken charge of the team while I attended
to the store. Once he came home badly
bunged up and a knife cut on his cheek. I said,
What has happened? He said he had some difficulty
with the Agent and they double teamed on
him. So I remarked, Well, you can send Perry
without you going. I wrote to the agent asking
him to deliver to the bearer, Perry, a load of
my merchandise then in his possession, to check
off the same and send me a list. We had at that
time two car loads on the track for the firm.
When Perry returned he failed to bring the list,
his wagon being loaded with corn and every
sack ripped more or less. I said, How come
you to accept merchandise in that condition. He
answered, the sacks were allright when I took
them out of the car, it was after they were
loaded one of them fellows, a white man named
Smith, run around the wagon and cut the sacks
and I spilled lots of corn. I picked up some of
it and put in that sack, indicating a sack &frac34; full.
I said, Do you know the man; would you recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
him again if you were to meet him? Oh
yes, Marse Ike. Saturday morning I took charge
of the team and my partner remained at the
store. I took dinner and fed my mules at my
friends' Mr. B. G. Smith, to whom I stated the
facts as told to me. He said, be careful, don't
be too hasty. I said, Right is right and I don't
want anything but my rights, and those I am
going to have before I return.</p>

<p>We arrived at our destination about four
o'clock p. m. The Sherman contingency had
burned the warehouse as they did all the others
along their march. Consequently the railroad
Company used passenger cars on the side track
to transact their office work, while freight cars
served as a warehouse until discharged of their
contents. As I entered the office car a young
man met me. I remarked, Are you the agent?
He said, No, Mr. Mims is at Parson Johnson's
house. What is your name? My name is
Smith. Then you are the scoundrel that mutilated
my goods, and I advanced. He run out of
the door and slammed it to with such force that
he shattered the glass panel into fragments.
When I came out to where Perry was, he said,
That's the fellow that cut the sacks, there he
goes. Well Perry build a little fire by the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
of this car for here we will camp until some one
returns to deliver us the freight. The sun had
set below the horizon and it had begun to get
night, when Mr. Tom Wells, an acquaintance of
mine, approached me. He was an employee of
the railroad company also. Well Ike, old fellow,
how are you getting along? All right Tom,
how are you? I am all right. What brought
you here, said he? I said business, I have goods
here if I can find an agent to deliver them. I
heard you came here for a difficulty, said he. I
remarked, It seems I am already in a difficulty, I
can't get any one to deliver me my goods. Well,
I will tell you, Mr. Mims is a perfect gentleman.
I am glad to hear it. Do you know him? No,
I have never seen him, but up to now I can't have
the same opinion of him that you have. I have
not been treated right and I came here for justice.
He said, Well, let me tell you; there are
about forty employees here, hands and all, and
they will all stick to him, right or wrong. I
said, I came here to see Mr. Mims and I intend
to stay here until I do see him, if it takes me a
week. Well Ike, if you promise me that you will
not raise a difficulty I will go after him and introduce
you to each other. I said, Tom, there
are other ways to settle a difficulty without fighting
if men want to do right. Well I will go for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
him; I know Mr. Mims is going to do what is
right, and you too. Mr. Mims came presently,
and a whole gang following him. I said, Mr.
Mims, it seems you and my partner had a difficulty.
I do not know the cause and I do not
care to know. He said you fellows double
teamed on him and he got worsted in the fight.
To avoid a recurrence of the difficulty I sent my
driver to you and a note. You ignored my note
and sent me a load of corn with all the sacks
ripped open, more or less, with a knife in the
hands of one of your employees. I berated my
man for accepting goods in that condition and
he stated to me how all of it was done. I am
now here to see what can be done about it. I
have never done you any injury to be treated in
that manner. He said, Mr. Hermann, I am sorry
it happened. I will see that it will not be done
again. I said, Have you discharged the fellow
who did it? He answered, No, not yet. I said,
Well, I demand that it be done now. And what
about the damage I sustained. He remarked
that the road would run to Tennille by next
Wednesday, a distance of 25 miles, and he would
forward my two car loads of freight free of
charge from Bartow to Tennille. I said that
was satisfactory. I wanted to load my wagon;
he said, we do not deliver goods at night. I answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
that if he had been at his post of duty on
my arrival I would have had plenty of time to
load and be on my way back, and I wished to
load up at once for the morrow being Sunday I
did not want to be on the road. He delivered
the merchandise and Perry and I passed Sunday
with my friend B. G. Smith, who was glad
matters passed off as they did. Monday morning
we took an early start and by twelve o'clock
I was at home. That was my last trip as a wagoner,
but not as a soldier, as the sequel will
show.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX.</h2>


<p>When the commanding officers of the Confederate
army surrendered and stacked arms the
rank and file expected that the terms of the cartel
promulgated and agreed upon would be carried
out to the letter. The men laid down their
arms in good faith, feeling as General R. E.
Lee remarked in his farewell address to them,
that under present unequal condition it would
only be a waste of precious lives to continue the
struggle. The following were the terms of the
agreement entered into between General Grant
and General Lee: The officers and men to return
to their homes and remain there until exchanged
and not to be disturbed by the United
States authorities so long as they observe their
paroles and the laws in force in their respective
states.</p>

<p>But the fellows who directed the ship of
state and who were invisible on the firing line
became invincible, when the South lay prostrated.
The first order was from Secretary
Staunton, for the arrest of our commanding officers.
This order, however, was resented by
General Grant as contrary to the cartel and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
should not be executed. This caused a rupture
between the two and the order was finally rescinded.
The next step was to disperse all State
authority and appoint a military Governor.
General Wilson acted in that capacity in Georgia.
The same year, 1865, negroes were proclaimed
free and military garrisons established
in every town, city or village throughout the
South. Under the superintendence of those
militaries the Freedmen's Bureau was established,
forcing negroes to migrate from one
place to another, thus breaking up the good relationship
still existing between Masters and
servants. The bureau was seemingly gotten up
for the protection of the blacks, as if they needed
any protection, they to whom we owed so much
for their good behavior during the time when
every available man able to bear arms was at
the front, leaving their families in charge of the
negroes. The gratitude of our people was or
ought to have been sufficient guarantee in that
line. Such harmonious condition did not suit
the powers that be, there was venom in their
heart for revenge, and punitive measures were
concocted. Never were captives bound tighter
than the people of the South. Is it a wonder
that the men of the South became desperate and
used desperate remedies to oust more desperate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
diseases? The carpet baggers made their exit.
The negroes' mind had been prejudiced under
the auspices of those vultures. They were forced
into societies, one of which was the Rising Sun.
Some called it The Rising Sons. God only
knows what ultimate result they expected to obtain.
Drums and fifes were heard in every direction
at night times. The woods were full of
rumors that the negroes are rising. Men in
towns made ready for emergencies, every one on
his own hook; no organization for defense, in
case harsher measures should be needed. When
the author of this sketch took up the idea of a reunion
of his comrades and inserted a call in the
county's weekly, calling on the members of
Howell's Battery for a social reunion, their
wives and children, when other veterans suggested
why not make it a reunion for all the veterans
of the County. I was only too glad for
the suggestion and changed the call to include
all veterans of the county, and on the day specified
there was the greatest reunion Washington
County ever had. It was estimated that eight
thousand people participated. There were over
one hundred carcasses besides thousands of baskets
filled to overflow with eatables and delicacies.
The object of the meeting was stated to
form an artillery company as a nucleus or rallying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
head and to meet organization with organization
not as a measure of aggression but as
a protection. The author was elected Captain.
Under his supervision he built an armory and
eventually the State furnished him with two
pieces of artillery. The day he received the
guns he had a salute fired. The boys in the rural
districts had not forgotten the sound of artillery
and the town was filled with enthusiasm. Some
of the negro leaders called on me to know what
all that means, I told them it was to teach their
misguided people that we can play at the same
game and if they don't stop beating their drums
and blowing fifes in the night time when honest
people are at rest I would shell the woods. This
admonition had a splendid effect and the people
of Washington have lived in peace ever since.
The author resigned his commission in the year
1881, when Honorable Alex Stephens was Governor
of Georgia. And Washington County has
the honor of having inaugurated the first reunion
of Confederate veterans. The citizens of
Washington County and Howell's Battery presented
the author with a gold headed ebony
cane, beautifully carved, as a memorial and
their regard for him as a citizen and a soldier.
Being taken by surprise I had to submit to the
caning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The South passed seemingly through the
chamber of horrors of the Spanish Inquisition
and punishments administered by degrees.
First robbing the owners of their slaves, of their
justly acquired property, after they, (the
North), received from the Southern farmer its
full equivalent in U. S. money. Second, in the
promulgation of the Civil Rights Bill, in April,
1866. Third, in forcing the Southern people to
accept the 14th and 15th amendment to the Federal
Constitution, not as a war measure, as
Abraham Lincoln claimed, when issuing his
proclamation to free the negroes, but as political
measures to perpetuate themselves in power.</p>

<p>Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana,
South Carolina and North Carolina refused to
accept those conditions and in consequence were
not admitted into the Union until 1868, although
paying enormous taxes without representation,
and finally had to submit in self defence. Virginia,
Texas and Mississippi held out until 1870
before they succumbed to the thumb screw.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXX.</h2>


<p>In writing the foregoing reminiscences I
came near omitting an incident that unless inserted
would make them incomplete. In 1868 I
went to New York, via. Charlotte, North Carolina.
It was a long journey by rail, on account
of many disconnections and lay overs. On arriving
at Greenville the South Carolina Legislators
had adjourned in Columbia and boarded the
train enroute for Washington, D. C. to see General
Grant inaugurated as President of the U.
S. The body at that time was composed of a
mongrel set of coal black negroes, mulattoes and
carpet baggers. Cartoosa, a mulatto, was then
Treasurer of the State. A negro named Miller
was General in chief of the S. C. militia of State
troops. They came prepared to have a regular
holiday. They carried large willow baskets full
of the best provisions and champagne by the
quantity, all at the expense of the State of South
Carolina. On arriving at Aqua Creek, which
was about 5 o'clock p. m., we took the boat up
the Potomac and were furnished with dinner.
When the bell rang, one of the South Carolina
Legislators, a coal black negro, took his seat at
the table when one of the waiters, also a negro,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
whispered in his ear. He replied in a very boisterous
manner that his money was as good as
any white man's. The waiter reported to the
Purser, who took the would be gentleman by
putting two fingers in his collar, lifted him up
and gave him a kick that sent him reeling into
the engine room. The white carpet baggers
seemed not to have noticed this little side show.
However the black brute continued his boisterous
remarks and abusing the white race, and
that he, a South Carolina representative had his
dignity grossly insulted and that he was going
to report the incident to General Grant on arrival.
When an old gentleman who must have
been between 65 and 70 years of age could not
stand his abuse any longer, although the balance
of the passengers were amused at his discomfiture
took a pistol from his coat side pocket,
shoved it near the negro's face and remarked,
I stood that abuse as long as I intend to; one
more word and I'll send you to hell where you
belong, you black brute. The representative,
seeing that this man meant what he said, kept
mum. The South Carolina delegation undoubtedly
made a report at headquarters of the above
incident, for in the winding up of President
Grant's inaugural address he expressed the following
sentiments: That he hoped that white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
and black races would conform to the situation
and that by mutual good conduct would maintain
the peace and harmony so necessary for
both races, or words to that effect.</p>

<p>Arriving in New York I took in the City. It
was my first trip there since I had landed at
Castle Garden from the four masted schooner,
The Geneese, nearly ten years previous. I visited
the large firm and emporium of H. B. Claflin
&amp; Company and spoke to Mr. Bancroft. I
gave him a statement of my commercial standing,
such as it was, and asked for his advice, as
it was my first attempt as a dry goods merchant.
My means being very limited I wanted
to make them reach as far as possible. He
treated me very courteously and furnished me
with a salesman, whom he introduced as Mr.
McClucklan. On our way to the basement he
asked me, What State? I said Georgia. D&mdash;&mdash;n
Georgia. I stopped at once, looking him
squarely in the face I said, You can't sell me any
goods, I am going for some one not prejudiced
against my State, and started back, when he exclaimed,
Hold on, you misconstrue me; I have
been a prisoner at Andersonville and I hate the
name of Georgia. I do not mean to say that
there are no good people in Georgia, like everywhere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
else. Noting a keystone that I wore on
my watch chain he said, I see you are a Mason?
So am I, displaying a square and compass
pinned on the lapel of his coat. We can talk
together, said he. If it had not been for a brother
Mason I don't think I'd be here today, I think
I would have died of starvation. He told me of
his transit from Andersonville to the Coast.
When the train stopped at a country station, the
name of which he did not know but he knew it
was on the Central railroad, he gave the words
of distress. It was a dark night, he could hardly
have expected anybody to answer it, but someone
did and before the train left some one
brought him enough fried ham and biscuit to
last him several days. So I said, It was wrapped
in a home made napkin with blue borders.
He looked at me with astonishment, saying, So
it was; what do you know about it. I said,
I am the fellow, and told him what I did and
that Mrs. Hardwick commended me for it and
would not take any pay and that the station was
Davisboro. The man was beside himself. He
hugged me, tears ran down his cheeks; he acted
like a crazy fellow. He said, You can't buy any
goods today, you are my guest. He ran to Mr.
Bancroft to get excused, saying that I was an
old friend and that he wanted to get off that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
day. He hired an open carriage and we drove
over the whole city, showing me everything
worth seeing. He carried me around to a fine
restaurant and ordered an elaborate dinner,
spent his money with the most lavish hand, regardless
of my protestations, for he would not
let me spend a copper. The following day I
made my purchases. It is useless to say that he
dealt squarely with me and with his advice and
experience I made what small capital I had purchase
me a very decent stock of merchandise.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXXI.</h2>


<p>Again when President Lincoln in 1863 issued
his edict to the Commanding Generals in their
respective territory to proclaim all the negroes
free, as a war measure, as he claimed, he attempted
on a large scale what John Brown
failed to make a success of on a small scale,
namely to create a servile insurrection, and thus
exposing the helpless and defenceless to the rapacity
of semi-savage hordes. But it failed, as
all other attempts in that line have failed, thus
again proving the good relationship existing between
the masters and their servants. Compare
the situation now with that of the ante-bellum
days. When a white emissary from the
North hired a horse and buggy from the proprietor
of the hotel in Sandersville, Washington
County, Georgia, and left with the same for
parts unknown, he was finally located in Florida
and captured and brought back and put in
jail. The lock of the jail was so rusted for the
want of use that it took the assistance of a locksmith
to open the door to let him in. How is
it now? A commodious building has had to be
erected to accommodate the masses who trample
under foot the laws of their country; the jails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and chaingangs are full to overflowing, with the
perpetrators of crimes. Those are the results
of the so called reconstructionists. Lynching
was an unknown quantity in those days; there
was no necessity for it. The laws of the country
were administered, justly and loyally. Courts
met at regular periods and often adjourned the
same day for the want of patronage. Some say
we are progressing. That is true, but in the
wrong direction. Retrogressing is the proper
word to apply, especially in morality.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXXII.</h2>


<p>Another illustration worthy of mention in
connection with the others is related here. A
friend of mine named John J. Jordan, wounded
at Vicksburg, Miss., one of the cleverest and
inoffensive beings, owned several slaves by heritage.
Among them was one John Foster, a mulatto.
He was an accomplished carpenter and
very active. His master gave him his own time
and he was comparatively free all his life, he
was devoted to the Jordan family and was a
very responsible negro, however, his newly
made friends the carpet baggers filled his brains
with such illusions that he became a leader
among the negroes, making speeches and made
himself very obnoxious to those who were his
friends from infancy. All at once Foster disappeared.
He was gone a couple of years when
his former master received a letter from him,
dated New York, begging assistance to enable
him to return to Washington County. Notwithstanding
his master's impoverished condition,
the money was sent him and Foster came
back entirely reformed. He had no more use
for the Yankees, his short stay among them
cured him. What a pity the authoress of Uncle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
Tom's Cabin did not take John Foster under
her protecting wings. What a lost opportunity!
What a fine additional illustration that picture
would have made to her already fertile imagination
as the sequel will show.</p>

<p>One day John Foster came to my house to
see me. Good day, Marse Ike, said he, I
thought I'll come to see you it has been a long
time since I sawn you, and the following conversation
took place: Where have you been John?
I've been to New York. How do you like New
York? I don't like it at all, let me tell you Mass
Ike, those Yankees are no friends of the negroes.
Well John I could have told you so before you
went. Mass Ike, let me tell you what they've
done. They told me I could make a fortune in
the North, that I could get four and five dollars
a day by my trade as a carpenter. Who told
you so? Why John E. Bryant and his like of
carpet baggers. Well did you not get it? I got
it in the neck, I tell you what they did. I left
here with right smart money, Marse John let
me pay him for my time and got nearly three
hundred dollars that I saved. I went to New
York, and after looking around the city for a
few days I commenced hunting work, but wherever
I went they shook their heads, for no. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
spent the whole winter there without striking a
lick until I spent all my money. I finally applied
at a shop where a dutchman was foreman, I was
willing to work at any price for I had to live but
do you know what they did? No John, I don't.
Well they every one of them, and they worked
twenty-five hands, laid down their tools and
walked out of the shop declaring that they
would not work by the side of any damned negro,
and the boss had to discharge me. No,
Marse Ike, the Yankees are no friends to we
colored people, only for what they can cheat us
out of. I worked all my life among white folks
here at home and it made no difference, I tell
you Marse Ike, the people of the South are the
negroes friends. Well John, you did not say so
before you left here. No, I did not appreciate
what the people here done for me until I went
North. Well, John, you ought to go among your
people and disabuse their minds and tell them
what you know from personal experience. I
am doing that Marse Ike every day. I have not
long to stay here below, I have contracted consumption
from exposure and am hardly able to
do a day's work. I am taking little jobs now and
then. Well John, if you stand in need of anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
come to see me. You will always find
something to eat here and some clothes to wear.
John died six months later.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXXIII.</h2>


<p>Before concluding these reminiscences I take
pleasure however in stating that Capt. Howell
and myself met after the surrender and after a
thorough understanding agreed that honors
were easy and by mutual consent to bury the
hatchet and eventually became warm friends. A
little incident, however, is worth relating here.
I was a delegate to a Governatorial Convention
from Washington County. Capt. Howell also
was a delegate from Fulton County, the vote
was very close. We were each for the opposing
candidate, the convention lasted for several days
and could not agree. Capt. Howell came to see
me, stating that he was a committee of one appointed
by the caucus to come to see me and influence
me to change my vote and vote for their
candidate. I said "Capt. what did you tell
them?" He said, "I said I doubt very much
that my influence would have any effect, darn
him I could not do anything with him when I
had the power to control him and I am satisfied
that my mission will be in vain." I said, "you
spoke well, Captain, go back and report failure."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>


<p><span class="smcap">Conclusion.</span></p>

<p>I would be derelict in my duty and the gratitude
I feel towards the noble women of the South
who shared the brunt of misery while their loved
ones were at the front suffering the hardship
and rigors of camp life, and were fighting the
battles for what they deemed their most sacred
duty. With aching heart and burning tears she
bade her dear ones God speed and a safe return,
shouldering all the responsibilities of providing
for those who were left behind and not able
to provide for themselves. Did they stop at
that? Many delicacies and garments were sent
to the front by them to cheer those in the field.
They organized wayside homes for those soldiers
who were in transit. They visited the
hospitals and administered to the sick and
wounded. They organized the ladies' relief association
and in every way imaginable added to
the comfort of those who shared the brunt of
battle. The Confederate veterans felt grateful
to their wives, daughters and kinswomen who
banded themselves together under the name of
U. D. C. They have proclaimed in songs and
stories the righteousness of the Confederate
cause and even at late date forced our adversaries
to admit that the cause we fought for was
right and the Courts so hold it. Would it be
too much to ask the United Confederate Veterans
to see that enduring monuments of imperishable
material be erected in the capital of every
Southern State to perpetuate the memory
and the fidelity of those noble heroines?</p>

<span class="caption"><br /><br />"I've stood that abuse as long as I intend to; one more word and I'll send you
to hell, where you belong&mdash;you black brute."</span>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>Sparta heroism was tame indeed in comparison
with that of Southern women, especially
those who were left in the wake of the invading
armies amidst the ruins of a once happy home.
It is a half a century that has elapsed since the
thunder of Fort Sumter shook this hemisphere.
New generations have appeared on the scene,
fraternization is progressing slowly, but surely,
the past is relegated gradually to the rear and
the States again assert their rights, as they see
it. Therefore it behooves the National administration
to see to it that equal rights to all and
special privileges to none, is its duty to enforce
so as to maintain this nation the greatest nation
on the globe. The sections must get together
and look to the wants and needs of their associates
and as far as lies in their power assist in
bringing relief. Thus past differences will vanish
and brotherly love will again prevail and this
United States of America will forever be united
to stand in bold relief the model government
in the world.</p>
